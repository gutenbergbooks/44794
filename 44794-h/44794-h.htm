<h2>
CHAPTER I<br /><br /><span class="s08">
THE BEAUTY OF THE RIVER
</span></h2>

<p>
Close your eyes and conjure up a vision of the
river Thames; what is the picture that you see? If
you are a prosaic and commercial person, whose
business lies by the river side, the vision will be
one of wharves and docks, of busy cranes loading
and unloading; a row of bonded warehouses
rising from the water's edge; lighters filled with
tea lying in their shadow, tarpaulined and padlocked;
ships of all sizes and shapes, worn by
water and weather. And up and down, in and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2'>[2]</a></span>
out, among it all you see river police on their
launch, inquisitive and determined, watching everything,
hearing everything, and turning up when
least expected. The glories of the high Tower
Bridge, and the smoky gold of the setting sun
will not affect you, for your thoughts are fixed
on prosaic detail. As for green fields and quiet
backwaters, such things do not enter into the
vision at all.
</p>

<p>
Yet for one who sees the Thames thus prosaically,
a hundred see it in a gayer aspect. To
many a man it is always summer there, for the
river knows him not when the chill grey days
draw in. He sees gay houseboats in new coats
of paint, decorated with scarlet geraniums and
other gaudy plants. He associates the river with
"a jolly good time" with a carefully chosen house-party,
with amateur tea-making and an absence
of care. Nowhere else is one so free to "laze"
without the rebuke even of one's own occasionally
too zealous conscience.
</p>

<p>
To another the Thames simply means the Boat
Race, nothing more and nothing less. Year by year
he journeys up to London from his tiny vicarage
in the heart of the country for that event. If the
high tide necessitates it, he stands shivering on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3'>[3]</a></span>
brink in the chill whiteness of early morning. He
sits on the edge of a hard wooden cart for an
immense time, and, by way of keeping up his
strength, eats an indigestible penny bun, a thing
that it would never enter his head to do at any other
time. He sees here and there one or the other of
those school-fellows or university chums who have
dropped out of his life for all the rest of the year.
Then, after a moment's shouting, a moment's
tense anxiety or bitter disappointment, according
to the position of the boats, the flutter of a
flag, and a thrill of something of the old enthusiasm
that the unsparing poverty of his life has
slowly ground out of him, he retires to his vicarage
again for another year, elated or depressed according
to the result of the race.
</p>

<p>
To others Henley is the embodiment of all
that is joyous; the one week in the year that is
worth counting. But to others, and these a vast
majority of those who know the river at all, the
Thames means fresh and life-giving air after a
week spent within four walls. It means congenial
exercise and light, and the refreshment that
beauty gives, even if but half realised. It means a
quiet dream with a favourite pipe in a deep backwater
so overhung with trees that it resembles a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
green tunnel. The gentle drone of the bees
sounds from the banks, there is a flash of blue
sheen as a kingfisher darts by; a gentle dip and
slight crackling tell of another favoured individual
making his way cautiously along to the same sheltered
alley; the radiant sunlight falls white upon the
water through the leaves and sends shimmering
reflections of dancing ripples on the sides of the
punt. Such a position is as near Paradise as it
is given to mortal to attain.
</p>

<p>
These are only a few of an inexhaustible variety
of aspects of this glorious river, and each reader
is welcome to add his own favourite to the list.

<p>
For the purposes of this book we are dealing
with the Thames between Oxford and London,
though as a matter of fact, tradition has it that
the Thames proper does not begin until below
Oxford, where it is formed by the junction of the
Thame and the Isis. Tamese (Thames) means
"smooth spreading water." Tam is the same root
as occurs in Tamar, etc., and the "es" is the perpetually
recurring word for water, <i>e.g.</i>, Ouse, ooze,
usquebagh. Isis is probably a back formation, from
Tamesis. In Drayton's <i>Polyolbion</i>, we have the
pretty allegory of the wedding of Thame and Isis,
from which union is born the sturdy Thames.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Now Fame had through this Isle divulged in every ear
</p>
<p>
The long expected day of marriage to be near,
</p>
<p>
That Isis, Cotswold's heir, long woo'd was lastly won,
</p>
<p>
And instantly should wed with Thame, old Chiltern's son.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
In Spenser's <i>Faërie Queene</i> the notion is
carried one step further, and Thames, the son of
Thame and Isis, is to wed with Medway, a far-fetched
conceit, for the rivers do not run into each
other in any part of their course.
</p>

<p>
It is strange that a river such as the Thames,
which, though by no means great as regards size,
has played an important part in the life of the
nation, should not have inspired more writers.
There is no striking poem on the Thames. The
older poets, Denham, Drayton, Spenser, Cowley,
Milton, and Pope, all refer to the river more or
less frequently, but they have not taken it as a
main theme. It is even more neglected by later
poets. There are poems to special parts or scenes,
such as Gray's well-known "Ode on a Distant
Prospect of Eton College"; the river colours one
or two of Matthew Arnold's poems; but the great
poem, which shall take it as a sole theme, is yet
to come. Neither is there a good book on this
river, though it is among rivers what London is
among the cities of men. Yet the material is
abundant, and associations are scattered thickly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
along the banks. No fewer than seven royal
palaces have stood by the river. And of these one
is still the principal home of our sovereign. Of
the others, Hampton Court, chiefly reminiscent
of William III., is standing. The neighbouring
palace of Richmond remains but in a fragment.
At London, Westminster, the home of our early and
mediæval kings, has vanished, except for the great
hall and a crypt. Whitehall&mdash;the old palace&mdash;is
wholly gone, though one part of the new palace
projected by James I. remains. As for the old
palace of Greenwich, so full of memories of the
Tudors, that has been replaced by a later structure.
I hesitate to name Kew in this list, so entirely
unworthy is it of the name of palace, yet, as the
residence of a king it should, perhaps, find a place.
</p>

<p>
From the annals of these palaces English history
could be completely reconstructed from the time
of Edward the Confessor to the present day.
</p>

<p>
But it is not in historical memories alone that
the Thames is so rich. Poets, authors, politicians,
and artists have crowded thickly on its banks
from generation to generation. The lower reaches
are haunted by the names of Hogarth, Cowley,
Thomson; further up we come to the homes of
Walpole, Pope, and Fielding. At Laleham lived
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
Matthew Arnold. Not far from Magna Charta
Island is Horton, where Milton lived. Though
his home was not actually on the river, Milton
must have often strolled along the banks of the
Thames, and many of his poems show the impress
of associations gathered from such scenery as is to
be found about Ankerwyke and Runneymead:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures,
</p>
<p>
While the landscape round it measures:
</p>
<p>
Russet lawns and fallows gray,
</p>
<p>
Where the nibbling flocks do stray.
</p>
<p>
Meadows trim with daisies pied;
</p>
<p>
Shallow brooks and rivers wide.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
From the records of Eton alone many a book
might be compiled of the lives of men in the public
eye, whose impressions were formed there by the
Thames side. Indeed, had the river no other
claim to notice than its connection with Eton
and Oxford, through which more men who have
controlled the destiny of their country and made
empire have passed, than through any similar
foundations in England, this alone would be cause
enough to make it a worthy subject for any book.
</p>

<p>
Beside palaces and the homes of great men,
castles and religious houses once stood thickly
along the banks of the river. The notable monasteries
of Reading, Dorchester, Chertsey, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
Abingdon, etc., were widely celebrated as seats
of learning in their day, and the castles of Reading,
Wallingford, and Oxford were no less well
known.
</p>

<p>
It is a curious law in rivers that, as a whole, the
windings usually cover double the length of the
direct axis, and the Thames is no exception to the
rule. It sweeps in and out with a fair amount of
regularity, the great bend to the south at Thames
Ditton and Weybridge being reversed higher up in
the great bend to the north at Bourne End and
Hambleden. Naturally the sides of these indentations
run north and south instead of in the usual
course of east and west. From Wargrave to
Henley the current is almost due north, and
likewise from Surbiton to Brentford. A more
apparent curve, because much smaller in radius, is
that at Abingdon; here the course by the stream
is about nine miles, in contrast to the two overland.
The Great Western Railway is the chief river
railway, but as it runs a comparatively straight
course between London and Didcot, some places
on the great curves are considerably off the
main line, and are served by branches. After
Reading it keeps very close to the river as far
as Moulsford, and is not distant from it the rest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
of the way to Oxford, as it turns almost direct
north from Didcot Junction. The Great Western
Railway is ably supplemented by the London and
South Western Railway, from which the lesser
stations on the south of the river near to London
can be reached, also the districts of Twickenham,
Hampton, etc., included in the chapter called
"The Londoners' Zone." Further up, Weybridge,
Chertsey, Egham, and Windsor can also be
reached by this railway, which cuts a curve and
touches the river again at Reading.
</p>

</div>
<p>
There are many zones on the river, and each has
its devotees. It is curious to notice how one
crowd differs from another crowd on its "people-pestered
shores." It is difficult to draw hard and
fast lines, but taking the boundaries of the London
County Council as the end of London, we can
count above it many zones, rich in beauty, divided
from each other by stretches of dulness; for,
beautiful as the river is, it must be admitted parts
of it are dull, though, like the patches on a fair
skin, these serve but to emphasise the characteristics
of the remainder. A rather dreary bit
succeeds Hammersmith, though this is not without
its own attractiveness, and the first real zone that
we can touch upon is that from Richmond to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
Hampton, which runs Maidenhead hard for first
place in popularity; but the Richmond and
Hampton river people are largely recruited from
the inhabitants, while those at Maidenhead are
mostly visitors. Passing over the waterworks and
embankments above Hampton, we begin another
zone, much less known because less accessible, but
in its own way more attractive than that of
Richmond. It is pure country, with green
fields, willow trees, cows grazing on the banks,
many curves and doublings in the channel of the
main stream, and ever varying vistas, and this
continues to beyond Weybridge. About Chertsey
the scenery is flat, but Laleham and Penton Hook
are two places that annually delight hundreds of
persons.
</p>

<p>
Between Staines and Windsor there is a fairly
attractive stretch, with the park and woods of
Ankerwyke on one side, and the meadows on the
other. High on the south rises Cooper's Hill, and
beyond Albert Bridge we see the smoothly kept
turf of the Home Park.
</p>

<p>
Windsor and Eton, of course, will require a
chapter to themselves. In this general description
it is sufficient to say that the influence of Eton is
apparent all the way to Bray. Then we start a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
new zone, the most popular one on the river,
that from Maidenhead to Bourne End. Of the
delights of this beautiful and varied section it is
unnecessary here to speak. But the Maidenhead
reach is spoilt for fastidious people by its too
great popularity. To those who love the river for
itself, the endless passing and repassing, the
impossibility of finding quiet, undisturbed corners,
the noise and merrymaking, even the sight of too
many fellow creatures, is a burden. From this the
part above Marlow is protected by being less
accessible. It is too far to be reached easily from
Maidenhead, and those who come by train have
an awkward change at a junction; therefore the
crowd finds it not. Yet the beauties are no less
admirable than those of the adored Maidenhead.
</p>

<p>
At Hambleden the influence of Henley begins
to be felt, and above Henley we enter on another
zone. Nowhere else on the river are to be found
so many fascinating spots lying in the stream;
certainly, no other part offers so many tempting
backwaters. This is the zone for those who
love the country pure and simple, and who can
put up cheerfully with the inconveniences attendant
on the procuring of supplies, for the sake of the
quiet, marshy meadows.

<p>
The reach includes Sonning with its two bridges,
its islands, and its rose-garden; but beyond Sonning
dulness is apparent once more, and with the neighbourhood
of the great and smoky town of Reading,
charm withers. It is not until Mapledurham that
the prettiness of the river becomes again apparent,
and Mapledurham is rather an oasis, for in the
reach beyond it, though the great rounded chalk
hills grow opal in the sunlight, and the larks sing
heavenwards, the attractiveness cannot be called
beauty. From Pangbourne and Whitchurch to
Goring and Streatley, the river lies beneath the
chalk heights, which seem to dip underground,
reappearing on the other side by Streatley; and the
whole of the stretch, with its rich and varied woods,
its delightful islands and weirs, its pretty cottages
and churches, is full of charm.

<p class="caption">DAY'S LOCK
</p>
</div>

<p>
Beyond Cleeve Lock, with the single exception
of Mongewell, there is again dulness, though for
boating pure and simple the reach is very good.
Wallingford has a trim prettiness of its own, with
its clean-cut stone bridge and its drooping willow.
Park-like grounds and pleasant trees succeed,
Sinodun Hill looms up ahead, and one may
penetrate up the Thame to Dorchester, where the
willows nearly meet overhead. Day's Lock still
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
belongs to the clean prettiness of the Wallingford
stretch, which, in fact, continues all the way to
Culham, notwithstanding that we pass the much
admired Clifton Hampden, where the church
stands high on the cliff. Culham itself is dull, but
with the pretty backwater of Sutton Courtney
we begin a new kind of scenery. Abingdon has
something of its richness and profusion, and
Nuneham Courtney woods, though not rising
so abruptly as those at Clieveden, are glorious.
After this we begin the famous meadows that
continue more or less all the way to Oxford, and
have a fascination of their own.
</p>

<p>
The best way to see the river as a whole, for
those who can spare the time, is to go on Salter's
steamers, which run daily, Sundays excepted,
during the summer. The fare one way is 14s.,
exclusive of food, and the night spent <i>en route</i>.
The trip takes two days, the steamer leaving
Kingston at 9 in the morning, and reaching Henley
at 7.15 in the evening. The reverse way, it leaves
Oxford at 9.30, and reaches Henley, which is
about half-way, at 7 in the evening.
</p>

<p>
In this rough sketch it has been shown that
there is no lack of choice for those who seek their
pleasure on the river, and the opportunity meets
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
with full response. Seen in sunshine on a summer
morning, especially if it be the end of the week,
the river is brilliant. The dainty coloured muslins
and laces, the Japanese parasols, the painted boats,
the large shady hats, the sparkle where the oars
meet the water, and the white sails of the sailing
boats bellying in the wind, are only a few items in
a sparkling picture. Fragile, yellow-white butterflies
and the richer coloured red admirals hover
about the banks; purple loose-strife, meadow-sweet,
and snapdragon grow on the banks with
many a tall gaudily coloured weed. Here and
there great cedars rise among the lighter foliage,
showing black against a turquoise sky; while on
the water, where the wind has ruffled it, there is
the "many twinkling smile" ascribed by Æschylus
to the ocean. But, to those who know the Thames,
this smiling aspect is not the only lovable one:
they know it also after rain, when the water comes
thundering over the weirs in translucent hoops
of vivid green, and the boiling foam below dances
like whipped cream. To walk along the sedgy
banks is to leave a trail of "squish-squash" with
every step. All the yellow and brown flat-leaved
green things that grow thickly near the
edges are barely able to keep their heads above
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
the stream, and the long reeds bend with the
current like curved swords. Every little tributary
gushes gurgling to join in the mad race, and
the sounds that tell of water are in our ears like
the instruments in an orchestra. There are the
rush, the dip, and the tinkle, as well as the deep-throated
roar. Watching and listening, we feel a
strange sympathy with the new life brought by the
increased current; we feel as if it were flooding
through our own veins, and as if we, like the
squirming, wriggling things that live in the slime
below the flood-curtain, were waking up anew
after a long torpor.

<p>
Even in late autumn, when the slow, white
mist rises from the marshy ground, and most of
the birds are gone; when the eddies are full of
dead leaves floating away from the wood where
all their sheltered lives have been spent; when the
sparkle and the gaiety and the light-heartedness
are gone, and the water looks indigo and dun, with
patches of quicksilver floating on it; when the
great webs of the spiders that haunt the banks
hang like filmy curtains of lace heavy with the
moisture of the air, and the sun sinks wanly
behind a bank of cloud&mdash;even then the river may
be loved.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Assuredly, those who go on the river for the day
only, and know it but under one aspect&mdash;that of
lazy heat&mdash;lose much. In the evening time,
as one steps from the long French window
into the scented dusk, soft white moths flap
suddenly across the strip of light, and one's
feet fall silently on the velvet turf, cool with
the freshness that ever is on a river margin.
Down by the edge the black water hurries swiftly
past with a continuous soothing gurgle. A sleepy
bird moves in a startled way in a bush, and all the
small things that awake in the night are stirring.
One can reach down and touch the onyx water
slipping between one's fingers like dream jewels;
and far overhead in the rent and torn caverns of
the clouds, the stars, bigger and brighter than ever
they look in London, sail swiftly and silently from
shelter to shelter. The plaintive cry of an owl
sounds softly from the meadow across the water,
and there is an indescribable sense of motion
and poetry, and a thrill of expectation that
would be wholly lacking in a landscape ever so
beautiful, without the river.
</p>

<p>
Then there are the grey days, when sudden
sheens of silver drop upon the ruffled water as it
eddies round a corner, and in a moment the surface
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
is peopled with dancing fairies, spangled and
brilliant, flitting in and out in bewildering movement.
Or the same cold, silver light catches the
side of a ploughed field, a moment before brown,
but now shot with green as all the long delicate
blades are revealed. These, and a thousand other
delights, cannot be known to the visitor of a day
only. Under all its aspects, in all its vagaries,
the river may be loved; and in the swift gliding
motion there is an irresistible fascination. It
gives meaning to idleness, and fills up vacancy.
By the banks of the river one never can be dull.
</p>

<p>
The river is one of the greatest of our national
possessions. Other rivers there are in England
where one may boat on a small part, where here
and there are beauty spots; but the Thames alone
gives miles of bewildering choice, and can take
hundreds and hundreds at once upon its flood.
Now embanked and weired and locked, its waters
are ideal for boating, and its fishing, with little
exception, is free to all.
</p>

<p>
Shooting on the banks of the Thames is forbidden,
and the birds have quickly learned to know
their sanctuary. Lie still for a while in the lee of
an osier-covered ait, or beneath the shelter of an
overhanging willow, and that cheeky little reed-bunting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
will hop about so near, that, were you
endowed by nature with the quickness of movement
granted to a cat, you could seize it in
one hand. White-throats, robins, thrushes, blackbirds,
all haunt the stream, and reed warblers
and sedge warblers have their haunts by the
banks. The kingfisher is rapidly increasing, and
makes his home quite close to the locks and weirs;
the russet brown of his breast, as he sits motionless
on a twig waiting his time for a dart, may now
be seen by a noiseless and sharp-eyed watcher.
The soft coo of the wood pigeons sounds from
tall trees, and the cawing of the rooks, softened by
distance into a melodious conversation, is wafted
from many a rookery. The chatter of an impudent
magpie may worry you, or the hoarse squawk
of a jay break your rest, but they are only the
discords that the great musician, Nature, knows
how to introduce into her river symphony.

<p>
Hotels on the river have, in the last few years,
awakened to the cry of the middle classes for air
and light, and yet more air. Some of the hotels
are pretty with verandahs and creeper covered
walls, but others are old-fashioned&mdash;with low
rooms. Yet every proprietor who can by hook or
crook manage it, now runs a lawn of exquisite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19'>[19]</a></span>
turf down to the water's edge, decorates it with
flowers far more vivid than can be seen elsewhere,
and knocks up a bungalow-like building, terribly
desolate in the winter when the green mould
creeps insidiously over the wooden posts, and
the sail-cloth rots in the damp; but airy and
commodious in the summer, when relays of fifty
people or more may be seated at a time, and yet
there is no satiating smell of cooked food. The
boat owners have also seen fit to accommodate
their convenience to the demand, and at any large
builder's landing-stage, boats may now be hired
to be left almost anywhere on the river, to be
fetched back by the owner.
</p>

<p>
Pessimists say that the river is losing its charm,
that the advent of motor cars, stirring in people a
hitherto dormant love of speed, makes the slow
progress of punting a weariness instead of a relaxation.
But this is not greatly to be feared. The
charm of a motor is one thing, the charm of
the river another; and we cannot spare either.
Crowds may slightly diminish, but this is no loss,
rather a gain to the real river lover.
</p>

<p>
Thames gardens are peculiar. By the nature of
the case they must be far more public than
ordinary gardens, for the owner's reason for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20'>[20]</a></span>
buying the house was that he wanted to sit on his
own green turf and see the river flow endlessly
past. Therefore, though he may hedge around
the three land sides with high walls and impenetrable
thorns, he leaves the fourth side open
so that all the world may look. No one has
yet been clever enough to invent a screen that
shall be transparent on one side and opaque on
the other, and until they do, the owners of these
beautiful river lawns must sit in the full light
that beats upon the river banks, and allow every
passing stranger who has raked up a shilling to
hire a boat, to enjoy the beauties of a garden he
has not paid for. Thames lawns are celebrated,
and rightly so. Not even the turf of college quads,
grown for hundreds of years, can beat their turf.
Thick, smooth, closely woven they are, and above
all, of a pure rich green that is a delight to see,
and, by way of enhancing this marvellous green,
the colour which is most often to be seen with
it is its complementary colour, red. Whether
the effect is obtained merely by contrast I do
not know, but certainly it seems as if nowhere
else could be found geraniums of so rich a vermilion,
roses of so glorious a crimson. In many of these
river gardens, too, especially where a little stream
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
trickles down, a light trellis arch is thrown up
and covered with Rambler roses, old rose in colour,
and only second to the vermilion as a complement
to the green lawn.
</p>

<p>
Two of these gloriously green lawns I have
particularly in mind, one at Shepperton, and
one near Thames Ditton, but where they are
to be seen so frequently it is invidious to particularise.
</p>

<p>
These are the private gardens of a grand sort,
and no whit less beautiful, though without the
same expanse of lawn, are the gardens of the
lock-keepers, in which the owners take a particular
pride.
</p>

But in taking count of Thames's decorations
we are not confined to gardens. Among the
flowers growing wild on the river banks we
have no lack of choice. It is a pretty conceit
of Drayton's, to make his bridal pair, Thame
and Isis, travel to meet one another along paths
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
flower-decked by willing nymphs. Old Thame,
as the man, was to have only wild flowers, not
those "to gardens that belong":

<p>
The "luscious smell" cannot refer to the harebell,
which has a very faint perfume; besides,
it is difficult to think of the harebell in this
connection, for it is a full summer flower, while
all the rest belong to spring: Drayton must,
therefore, mean the wild hyacinth, which is still
often called the bluebell by people in England,
though in Scotland this name is correctly reserved
for the harebell. The "luscious smell" exactly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>[23]</a></span>
describes the rich, rather cloying scent of the
hyacinth. There has been some discussion as
to what is meant by the eglantine, which the
old poets are so fond of mentioning. In Milton it
means the honeysuckle, but in the others probably
the sweetbriar; while woodbine is either the twining
clematis, the "traveller's joy"&mdash;rather a misnomer,
by-the-way, as it is an insignificant and disappointing
flower&mdash;or the honeysuckle.
</p>

<p>
Isis was gay with garden flowers:

<p>
To make a catalogue of the flowers which may
be found on the Thames banks at the present
day would be out of place here, yet there are
one or two plants so frequently seen that they
may be mentioned. Among these are the purple
loose-strife, with its tapering, richly coloured
spikes, standing sometimes as high as four feet,
and occasionally mistaken for a foxglove; the
pink-flowered willow-herb; the wild mustard or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>
cherlock, with its sulphur yellow blossoms, and
creeping-jenny. The bog-bean, or buck-bean, with
white lace-like flowers may be seen occasionally
in stagnant swamps. The water-violet, which,
however, is not in the least like a violet, is also
to be found in the tributary ditches, as well as the
tall yellow iris; the flowering rush and the bur-reeds
often form details in a river picture. In the
lock gardens herbaceous borders, full of phlox,
sweet-william, stocks, valerian, big white lilies,
and, later, red hot pokers, sunflowers, and hollyhocks,
are ordinary sights. In the meadows near
Oxford fritillaries, otherwise called snakes'-heads,
are seen abundantly in spring, but these and other
flowers shall be mentioned more particularly in
connection with the places where they grow.

<p>
It remains but to end with the aspiration of

<p>
This account of
the river may well
begin at Folly
Bridge, seeing it
is folly in any case
to attempt to cut
off a section of a
river, and, as before
explained,
our course from
Oxford to London
is peculiarly arbitrary,
for the
Thames proper
does not begin till below Dorchester, and at
Oxford the river is the Isis. Having thus
disarmed criticism, without further explanation
or apology, we stand upon Folly Bridge, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
is a little way above the end of the course for
both Torpids and Eights.
</p>

<p>
To the left are the college barges, resplendent
in many colours, with their slender flagstaffs
rising against a background of the shady trees
that border Christchurch meadows. The reach
of water beside them is alive with boats, and the
oars rise and dip with the regularity of the legs
of a monster centipede. The barges should be
seen in Eights week, when they are in their
glory, occupied by the mothers, sisters, and aunts
of the undergraduates, dressed in costumes that
in mass look like brilliant flower-beds.
</p>

<p>
To see the bridge properly, however, it is
necessary to go down to the tow-path and look
back at it, when its quaint, foreign appearance
can be better estimated. It stands across an
island on which is the renowned Salter's boat-house,
and its solidity and the tall houses near it,
which throw black shadows in the yellow sunlight,
make it look not unlike a corner in Venice.
</p>

<p>
Following the river down, we see on the Oxford
side the narrow mouth of the meandering Cherwell
under a white arched bridge. The most delightful
place for "lazing" in a boat is the Cherwell,
shady and not too wide; deliciously cool in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27'>[27]</a></span>
height of the summer, so rich is the foliage of
the over-arching trees. Lower down is the
New Cut, destined to relieve the Cherwell of
its superfluous water in flood time and so prevent
the flooding of the Christchurch meadows.
Opposite the mouth of the New Cut is the
University Boat-house, and further down, where
a branch of the river runs off to the right, are
the bathing places. This branch is crossed by
a bridge, and it makes the next strip of land an
island. The place is known as the Long Bridges.
The river narrows at the point, and the narrowed part
is called The Gut; just below a tributary from the
Cherwell, known as the Freshman's river, dribbles
into the Thames. It is at The Gut that the most
exciting scenes in the races generally happen. As
everyone knows, Torpids are in the fourth and
fifth weeks after the beginning of the Lent term,
and as they are not of so much importance as the
Eights, and as the weather does not lend itself to
open-air festivities, they are generally watched only
by a shivering handful of spectators who have a
more or less personal interest in them. The Eights,
which take place in the middle of the summer term,
are the event of the year to Oxford, and intensely
exciting they may be. The lowest boat starts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>
from the lasher above Iffley, and the course ends
at Salter's Barge. But the crux of the whole
matter often lies in The Gut, and much depends on
the ability of the cox to steer a clean course, as to
whether his boat is bumped or bumps. As the
boats in cutting the curve below this crucial point
come diagonally at it, disaster here often overtakes
a crew which has before been doing well. The
aforesaid narrow channel from the Cherwell is
navigable only in a canoe and by good luck; but
the tale is told that one cox, in his first year, being
excited beyond reason, mistook it for the main
channel, and, steering right ahead, landed his crew
high and dry on the shoals. Hence the name, the
Freshman's river.<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'></a></span>

<p>
Here are two pictures, taken from life, which
express the difference between the two occasions:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Eights: Brilliant blue sky above, glinting blue
water beneath. Down across Christchurch meadow troops
a butterfly crowd, flaunting brilliant parasols and chattering
gaily to the "flannelled fools" who form the escort. Despite
the laughter it is a solemn occasion, for the college boat
that is head of the river may be going to be bumped this
afternoon, and, if so, the bump will surely take place in
front of the barges. The only question is, before which
barge will it happen? When the exciting moment draws
near, chatter ceases, a tense stillness holds the crowd in
thrall; the relentless pursuers creep on steadily, narrowing
the gap between themselves and the first boat, and finally
bump it exactly opposite its own barge! A moment's pause.
The completeness of the triumph is too impressive to be
grasped at once; then&mdash;pandemonium! Pistol-shots, rattles,
hoots, yells, shrieks of joy, wildly waving parasols, and groans.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The Torpids: A raw cold February day; a leaden sky
heavy with snow; dimly seen figures scudding over the
frozen meadows of Iffley; the river itself is almost frost-bound,
and the men waiting in the boats for the starting
gun look blue and pinched. They must find these last ten
seconds hard to endure. Nine, eight, seven, six&mdash;ugh!
will it never go? At last! And, as the signal sounds, the
oars strike the water with a splash, and the boats shoot off
and begin the long tussle against a head wind and that
strong stream which always makes the Torpids a harder
matter than the Eights rowed in summer water. It is too
late to follow them, so heigh-ho for the King's Arms
Hotel at Sandford, and a cup of the good hot tea that the
landlady knows so well how to make!
</p>
</div>

<p>
The channel running past the bathing places is
equally unsuited for navigation, and is moreover
guarded by two mills, but it may be negotiated
with the aforesaid element of good luck. Hinksey
Stream flows into this backwater, and there are
several places, after shoals have been avoided or
surmounted, where it is extremely pleasant to
while away an idle hour. By means of the Long
Bridges and the lock at Iffley it is possible to
get across the river from side to side diagonally.
Passing on down stream we soon come to Iffley.
In the meantime we can see many of the pinnacles

and spires and domes for which Oxford is famous,
and marvellous is the way in which they appear to
swing round as we change our position. The part
of new Oxford which lines the Iffley road behind
the meadows is not attractive, but when we come
in sight of Iffley itself we may well exclaim that
it would be hard to find a sweeter spot. There are
stone walls, thatched cottages and farmyards, hay
and orchards, elms, alders, and silver-stemmed
birches; in consequence a quiet, rural atmosphere
broods over all. The cows feed down to the edge of
the river, and swallows dart about overhead, while
perhaps a man paddling a canoe shoots up and away
again, his white flannels and the strength and grace
of his movement irresistibly recalling a swan. The
mill, half stone, half wooden cased, is very ancient;
the massive foundations have become like rock
from their long immersion in the running water.
There is a great quiet pool behind the lock island,
and here and there a glimpse may be caught of the
square tower of the famous church, which is not
far off, but is well hidden by trees.
</p>

<p>
Iffley Church takes rank with Stewkley as the
most beautiful example of a Norman church
remaining to us out of London. It is, like so
many Norman churches, very small and very solid.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
And it must yield to Stewkley in the fact that its
architecture is not pure. Yet its massive central
tower and its fine windows place it very high
indeed. Its date is not certainly known, but is
supposed to be between 1160 and 1170. "The
interior seems at first sight curious. There are,
in fact, two chancels, one behind the other. The
further one is early English work, and is much
lighter in style than the rest of the building, and
the east end is disappointing. This may have been
added to lengthen the church. In the bay next
to it, where the choir now sit, there are fourteenth
century windows inserted under Norman arches,
showing that the walls were of the earlier date.
These windows were added by John de la Pole,
Duke of Suffolk, in the latter half of the sixteenth
century. There is a groined roof, and the piers are
beautifully decorated. The arches supporting the
tower are richly moulded, almost incongruously so
in regard to the massive type of the masonry,
which points to early Norman. The Perpendicular
windows inserted in the north and south walls are
good. It is only at the extreme west end that the
Norman windows remain untouched. The font
is of black marble, and is very curious. The triple
west-end window, a splendid specimen, is best seen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>[32]</a></span>
from the churchyard. Its moulding is very rich,
and this alone would be sufficient to make Iffley
rank high among ancient churches. Below it is
a circular window inserted about 1858 on the
supposed plan of a former one of which traces were
found. The impossibility of approaching the style
of the old work in modern times was never more
strikingly shown. Below is a fine doorway with
beak-head and billet moulding, worthy to be
classed with the triple window. A very ancient
yew stands on the south side of the church, and
near it is the slender shaft of an old cross. The
rectory house, dating from Tudor times, is a fine
addition to the picturesque group."&mdash;<i>Guide to the
Thames.</i>

<p>
Between Iffley and Sandford the famous Oxford
meadows are seen at their best. In the summer
they are gemmed with countless flowers, so that
they rival the celebrated Swiss pastures. Prominent
among these is the fritillary:
</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>
Mr. G. Claridge Druce, the well-known botanist,
who has made a special study of the Thames
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
Valley and Oxfordshire, says:&mdash;"The Thames
from Oxford to Sandford flows through meadows
rich with fritillaries, its banks are bordered with
the sweet-scented Acorus, and its waters are
inhabited by Potamogeton prœlongus, flabellatus,
and compressus, Zannichellia macrostemon,
Œnanthe fluviatilis, &amp;c., and near Sandford appears,
for the first time in the river's course, the lovely
Leucojum æstivum." This is the flower better
known as the summer snowflake, which we shall
meet again. The above are only a tithe of the
flowers which Mr. Druce mentions. Among others
which may be recognised are the yellow iris,
the cuckoo flower, the water villarsia, the purple
orchis, and the willow weed. In the spring the
marsh mallow is the first to appear with a
vivid glory as of sunshine. The banks are
flat and low, and, except for the flowers,
uninteresting; nevertheless this is a useful part of
the river, especially for sailing. Some college fours
are rowed here. Passing under the railway line
we see the pink-washed walls of the Swan Hotel,
which stands on Kennington Island, connected with
the mainland by a bridge; and then we come to
Sandford itself, with charms almost as great as,
though entirely different from, those of Iffley.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>[34]</a></span>
The approach is disappointing. The tall mill
chimney and the new brick houses are bare and
ugly. The mill is a paper mill, and supplies
the Clarendon Press. It stands close to the
old-fashioned and pretty hotel, so completely
ivy-covered that even one of the tall chimneys
is quite overgrown. When close to the lock
the mill is not noticeable and has the advantage
of affording some shelter. As at Iffley, one can
get right across from bank to bank by means of
bridges, a most charming method that might well
be adopted in other parts of the river. Indeed,
near Oxford one great delight is the freedom from
interference. Everyone is allowed full liberty;
you may ride your bicycle along the tow-path,
take it across locks, or even walk it by the side of
the meadows, without any rebuke. Having put up
a notice that they are not responsible for the condition
of the tow-path and that people use it at
their own risk, the Conservancy leave the matter
alone. The islands at Sandford are rather complicated,
and there are a couple of weirs, beneath
which the water frills out over mossy stones into
deep, shady pools. The fishing here is as good as
any on the river. The Radley College boat-house
and bathing place are near the lower pool, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
college itself being rather more than a mile away.
In spring these pools, with their broken banks of
brown earth and their masses of scented white
hawthorn, are most beautiful. The shy white
violets hide in the grass near the weirs, and are
found by only a few who know where to seek
them.

In the Oxford zone we must include the woods
at Nuneham Courtney, which, by the courtesy of
the owner (Aubrey Harcourt), are open to undergraduates
all Commemoration week and twice a
week in the summer term; while the general
public, after writing in advance, are allowed to
picnic at the lock cottages two days a week from
May to September. The Nuneham woods are on
a ridge of greensand, and though they are not so
high or at such a striking angle as those of
Clieveden, they certainly have quite as great a
charm. Anyone is allowed to walk through the
park if it be approached from the road, but
bicycles are not permitted. The lock cottages,
which are a popular resort in the summer, stand
beside a pretty wooden bridge which connects the
islands with the mainland. Masses of wild roses
and flowering clematis add their delicate touch
to the beauty of the overhanging trees. Close
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
by the water is the Carfax monument, a conduit
or fountain erected by Otho Nicholson, who set it
up at the place still called Carfax in Oxford,
whence it was removed to its present position in
1787. The woods contain nothing very striking
in the way of trees, though all the commoner
sorts, the beeches, oaks, horse-chestnuts, and so
on, are well represented. There are about 400 acres
of wood, which surround the park, where the oaks
show well, standing apart from each other.

CHAPTER III<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
THE OLD TOWN OF ABINGDON
</span></h2>

<p>
As a headquarters for boating, for those who want
to dawdle and explore odd corners and have no
desire to rush through as many locks as possible
in a day, Abingdon makes a good centre. It
is within easy reach of the part lying below the
woods at Nuneham, and in the other direction is
the Sutton Courtney backwater, which, Wargrave
notwithstanding, is not to be beaten on the Thames.
Further down again is Clifton Hampden, which
attracts many people, and the river at Abingdon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
itself is by no means to be despised. The bridge,
called Burford Bridge, is a real delight. It is old
and irregular, with straggling arches, some rounded,
some pointed; and all, even the highest, comparatively
low down over the water, framing cool, dark
shadows within the embrace of the mighty piers.
The bridge cannot be seen in the glance of an eye.
It is very long, and rests partly on an island.
Standing on this, the Nag's Head Inn projects
from one side of the bridge, and from it stretches
out a small garden with several orchard trees.
The red tiles and creamy tint of the hotel walls
show well in contrast with the grey stone of the
bridge, and when the hotel is seen from the river
above the bridge, with the tall spire of St. Helen's
Church rising behind it, it is worth noticing.
</p>

<p class="caption">ABINGDON
</p>
</div>

<p>
There are bits of old wall lining the bank on the
town side, and ivy grows freely over them. Many
of the houses stand back from the water; a part
of the ruined abbey and the long range of the
abbot's residence can be seen between masses of
blossom. The great exterior chimney of the abbey
buildings should particularly be noticed. The
blossom at Abingdon is a great feature, and one
not to be found everywhere. Horse-chestnuts and
holm oaks dip their boughs in the water, and from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
the branches arises a perfect chorus of birds. Abingdon
has its chimneys, of course, as well as hideous
buildings suited to modern requirements of business,
but in the general view these things are lost sight of.
</p>

<p>
Burford is a corruption of Borough-ford, and
before the building of the bridge in the fifteenth
century, the ferry at Culham was the main means
of communication with the other side of the river.
</p>

<p>
The range of Nuneham, below which runs the
backwater called the Old River, can be seen to the
south-east. If this ever was the main stream it
must have been very long ago, for the memory of
it is not recorded in any document now extant.
The Old River is crossed by another bridge, and
the two are linked by a straight road, made by
Geoffrey Barbour at the same time as the building
of the bridges. There is a picture of Barbour
in the almshouses, and this shows the bridge being
built in the background; while an illuminated copy
of verses tells us:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Below Burford Bridge, the great bur-reeds
grow near the islands. There is one delightful old
house, formerly a malt house, with all sorts of odd
angles and corners. It encloses a small terraced
court, from which steps lead down to the water.
It stands on the site of St. Helen's nunnery,
founded about 690. Further on are some of the
newer almshouses&mdash;a blot on the scene; and then
a glimpse may be had of the wooden cloister of
the old almshouses, which, in their way, are as
pretty as those at Bray.
</p>

<p>
Christ's Hospital, as the almshouses are called,
was founded in the reign of Edward VI. out of
lands belonging to a dissolved Guild of the Holy
Cross. The central hall dates, however, from 1400.
It has a stone mullioned window and panelled
walls; in the ceiling is a dome or cupola. Once a
week eighty loaves of bread are here distributed
among the poor people of the town, and when the
loaves, with their crisp, flaky, yellow crust, stand
in piles on the polished oak table, and the poor old
people gather for their share, there is an old-world
touch in the picture such as one does not often see
nowadays. The cloister or arcade of dark wood
outside is decorated with texts and proverbs on its
inner wall. The newer almshouses, built in 1797,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
lack all the homeliness and interest of the older
ones. The church of St. Helen's, which has a very
tall spire, is close to the almshouses and the river,
and is well worthy of its position. It has been
much restored, but is mainly of sixteenth century
work.

<p class="caption">THE MILL AT ABINGDON
</p>
</div>

<p>
Of course there was an abbey at Abingdon, though
whether the name of the town arose from that fact
or from a proper name Aben or Æbba is doubtful.
The earliest name of the town was the unpronounceable
one of Seovechesham, and it was then a
royal residence. The abbey was founded by Cissa
about 675. It was destroyed by the Danes and
reconstructed long before most places on the river
had begun to have any history at all. The abbey
rose to great importance and wealth. It held
manors innumerable, and its abbot was a person
to reckon with. Even at the date of Domesday
Book the abbey held no less than thirty manors.
But its power did not save it, and it suffered the
common fate at the Dissolution. A gateway of
about the fourteenth century and some ruins,
which show where the dwellings of the monks
stood, are all that remain, beside the guest-chamber&mdash;a
large, barn-like building&mdash;and the almoner's residence.
The latter has a magnificent fireplace and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>[42]</a></span>
chimney. The ceiling of the room below is groined,
and looks like that of a crypt, but this is said to
have been the kitchen. The chief feature of
interest is the huge chimney, which is like a room,
and has little windows on each side; its size is best
appreciated from the exterior view. The church
has quite disappeared, for the little ancient church
near the gateway was not the abbey church, but is
supposed to have been at first a chapel of ease.
In this there is some Norman work, including the
west doorway, and it is probably of quite as
ancient lineage as anything now remaining of the
abbey.
</p>

<p>
Henry I. was sent by his father, as a lad of
twelve, to be educated at Abingdon Abbey, and the
learning by which he gained the name of Beauclerc
shows that there must have been some able men
here. The town hall in the market place at
Abingdon is really a fine bit of work. It has been
attributed to Inigo Jones, and stands over an open
arcade, according to the style of town halls of the
seventeenth century. The lock is a good way above
Abingdon, and from it the millstream, as usual
a pleasant backwater, flows right back to the town,
enclosing a large island.
</p>

<img src="images/i-097.jpg" width="550" height="439" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SUTTON COURTNEY BACKWATER
</p>
</div>

<p>
The lock at Culham is one of the least interesting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>[43]</a></span>
on the river, and of the hundreds who pass
through it only a few know that they are close to
the very prettiest backwater on the Thames,
namely Sutton Pool. There is one backwater at
Sutton Courtney which can be reached from above
Culham Lock. This leads to the mill, now disused,
and runs along the top of the numerous weirs that
pour into Sutton Pool itself. It is pretty also, and
it is pleasant to see the meadows where the cows
stand knee-deep in flowering plants, and the little
square tower of the church peeping through the
trees. This backwater is the best for landing to
go to the village. Along the top of the weirs runs
a path&mdash;a public right-of-way&mdash;which leads across
the fields to Culham Lock, and anyone may land
here and look down upon the pool; but to get
right into it the lock must be passed, and some
way further, after going under the bridge, we can
turn the corner of a large island and retrace our
way upstream until we come into the great pool,
with its miniature bays and tumbling water. The
weirs are high, and the streams come down with
force, making a restless heave and swell when the
river is full. The little tongues of land that divide
one bay from another are shaded by willows, and
the lush green grass grows here and there around
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
tiny beaches of white sand. In spring, masses of
hawthorn, "all frosted" with flowers, bend down
from above, and the wild hyacinths break up
between the blades of grass. Tall reeds form tiny
islets, and perhaps a little moorhen flaps out. It is
in secluded places like this that the dainty nest
of the reed-warbler may be seen, swinging so
lightly upon its supports that it is extraordinary
to think that so large a bird as the cuckoo should
dare to deposit its egg there. Yet reed-warblers
and sedge-warblers are both among the cuckoo's
victims. Unfortunately, in this little paradise landing
is everywhere strictly forbidden, but no one can
forbid enjoyment of the beauties which appeal to
sight.

<p>
The village of Sutton Courtney is certainly
worth visiting. The village green, with its tall
chestnuts, limes, and elms, is the very picture of
what a green should be. The church is particularly
interesting, for it is that rarity an unrestored building,
with the old red-tiled floor and the rudeness
of the original&mdash;so often smoothed away behind
stencilling and paint&mdash;still left untouched. There
is a shelf of chained books, a fine carved screen,
and an altar-tomb of some interest. The manor
house, which is not far off, is in a medley of styles,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>[45]</a></span>
ranging from Norman to Jacobean. Malefactors
are said to have been hanged from the stout oak
beam which is still in good preservation. One
wing is of perfect Jacobean work, with an overhanging
storey decorated with carved pendants. A
fine old building, half-way up the village, is called
the Hall of Justice; this, however, may have a
meaning less obvious than supposed at first sight,
as the family of Justice held the manor for some
generations.
</p>

<p>
In it there is a fine old Norman doorway.
The owner has furnished the interior with tapestry
hangings, etc., somewhat in accordance with what
it may have looked like originally when in use.
It certainly gives one an idea of the old Saxon
or Norman style of dwelling before even the upper
chamber or <i>solar</i> came into fashion.
</p>

<p>
The river at Clifton Hampden is not a couple
of miles from the river at Nuneham Courtney,
so great is the loop by Abingdon. It may be noted
that the name Courtney, though spelt differently,
is derived from the ownership of the Courtenays,
Earls of Exeter, in both the instances above.
Clifton Hampden is a great favourite with artists,
for the church, with its little, pointed spire, stands
on a cliff which has in parts broken away, showing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
the rich yellow ochre of the soil. This makes
up well in a "composition." The river sweeps
round beneath it in a sort of little bay, and when
white ducks dabble in the water and blue-pinafored
children play beneath the yellow-ochre cliff, there
is much to be said for it. The houses, too, are
not without points. They are mostly thatched,
and have their share of plants and creepers. The
bridge is of red brick, and, with a little toning by
weather, will make a capital accessory. But to
my mind Clifton Hampden lacks that indefinable
quality of charm found in such abundance
elsewhere.

CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
SINODUN HILL AND DORCHESTER
</span></h2>

<p>
The island near Day's Lock, lying beneath the
Wittenham Woods and Sinodun Hill, is particularly
well kept and neat, and, in summer, bright
with flowers. Standing on the end of the lock-keeper's
island you can look straight up the weir,
below which the river drifts away on each side
of the island.
</p>

<p>
On the right bank, raised slightly above the
river, is the church of Little Wittenham, with
a long, narrow bastion turret adhering to its tower.
Inside there is a handsome monument, one of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>
those legacies from the ages that prove long
descent. A warm belt of Scotch firs grows near.
</p>

<p>
Wittenham Woods lie under the shelter of the
hill and close to the life-giving water. The trees
grow well and form a home for countless birds of
all kinds. "The hobby breeds there yearly. The
wild pheasant, crow, sparrowhawk, kestrel, magpie,
jay, ring-dove, brown owl, water-hen (on the river-bounded
side); in summer the cuckoo and turtle-dove
are all found there, and, with the exception
of the pigeons and kestrels, which seek their food
at a distance during the day, they seldom leave the
shelter of its trees."&mdash;<i>C. J. Cornish.</i>

<p class="caption">COTTAGES, DORCHESTER
</p>
</div>

<p>
Sinodun Hill, and its companion, Harp Hill,
which is as like it as one twin to another,
are sometimes called Wittenham Clumps. They
are remarkable and conspicuous objects, rising
abruptly and evenly from a very flat district, and
they can be seen from many miles around, and,
what is more curious, can be recognised. The
smooth, rounded cone is so symmetrical that,
whichever way you look at it, it seems the same,
not changing its shape in the bewildering way of
most hills; and the clump of trees placed so
exactly on its crown is an unfailing river-mark.
Sinodun is about 250 feet in height, and on it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
a British earthwork, a triple line of entrenchment,
with vallum and foss all round. The circumference
of this on the outside is about a mile.
Harp Hill has on it a tumulus called Brightwell
Barrow. Then down below, close to Dorchester,
is a double line of earthworks, much mutilated,
but quite noticeable. No one knows the origin
of these defences, which date far back into
unhistorical days. Those on Sinodun are called
British, while the others are supposed to be Roman.
Roman camps were nearly always square, while
British followed the windings of the hill.
</p>

<p>
Dorchester, with its cornfields and trees, its
vegetable gardens, and its old houses bowed this
way and that, is a very unsophisticated little place.
The deep quiet of its village street, where the
cottages glow all hues in the sunlight, from deep
red ochre to egg-colour, brooded over by the long-backed
abbey church, is a rest-cure in itself. The
great yew trees, the pretty lych-gate, the old
wooden porch, are all just what one would expect
to find. Dorchester is not on the Thames, yet
belongs to it certainly, for the Thame, which
combines with the Isis to form the Thames, flows
past it. As its name proclaims, Dorchester was
once a Roman camp. Numerous Roman coins
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
have been found in the neighbourhood, and a
Roman altar. It was also the seat of one of the
first and largest bishoprics in England.
</p>

<p>
In 634 a monk of the order of St. Benedict, named
Birinus, crossed to Britain to follow in the steps of
St. Augustine and work as a missionary among
the men of Wessex. He landed safely, and came
to this part of the country, then in Wessex, which
at that time stretched north of the Thames, though
afterwards, when Mercia's power became great
under King Offa, Dorchester fell within that
kingdom. Birinus preached with so much effect
that the King conferred upon him the office of
bishop and gave him Dorchester for his residence.
He died in 650 and was buried in his own church,
though it is said his body was afterwards moved
to Winchester.

<p>
The early bishopric was vast. It included what
in our own day are the Sees of Bath and Wells,
Exeter, Hereford, Lichfield, Lincoln, Salisbury,
Worcester, and Winchester. There must have
been a church in some degree adequate to the
importance of such a charge, but it was probably
of wood; in any case, nothing remains of it,
though certain indications seem to show that it
stood on the same site as the present one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Dorchester was an important city, but its glory
did not long remain, and the bishopric was ultimately
split up into many Sees. In 1085 the seat
of the See of Mercia was transferred to Lincoln.
The abbey was founded here in 1140 for Augustinian
monks, and it is the monks' church which
still in great part exists. The long nave, with its
red roof, is seen easily from the river, but the
tower appears rather inadequate in height. On
approaching, however, it is found to be of massive
work. The interior of the church is wide and
high, and gives that impression of bareness which
is consistent with Norman work. In the east
window is a great pier or transom which is supposed
to have been originally intended as the
support for a groined roof. The north chancel
window is the famous Jesse window, with carved
tracery, carrying figures all the way up the
numerous branches. The lowest is that of Jesse,
from whom spring all the subsequent ones.
Very few figures are missing, considering the age
of the window, and the carving is remarkably
interesting. It is supposed that the figures of the
Virgin and Child were at one time above that of
the patriarch, but were removed at the Reformation.
The rich green glass in the sedilia on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
other side of the chancel should be noted. It
is unusual to see sedilia pierced. Two of the nave
arches are plain Norman work. A rood door
remains, and there are one or two handsome altar
tombs; also a leaden font, well moulded, and,
on the east wall of the south aisle, there are
some remains of frescoes. Close to the porch
outside is a graceful shaft with a "restored" head.
</p>

<p>
The Thame we have already spoken of. Its
arching trees and corners, and deep shady alleys,
make it a delightful place for an idler. It runs
close by the abbey church.

CHAPTER V<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
CASTLE AND STRONGHOLD
</span></h2>

<p>
Wallingford boasts of having the oldest corporation
in England, preceding that of London
by a hundred years, and its record certainly
reaches very far back. In 1006 it was destroyed
by the Danes. William the Conqueror rested
here on his way to London after the battle of
Hastings. The town was then held by Wigod,
a noble Saxon, who lived in his great fortress-castle.
His son-in-law was Robert D'Oyley,
who built the castle at Oxford, and rebuilt and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>[54]</a></span>
greatly strengthened that at Wallingford. From
the part of the river above the bridge a tree-grown
mound can be seen, and, further back, a comparatively
modern house. On the mound once stood
the strong castle, and the modern house is its
present-day representative. The grounds are
famous for their trees, and particularly for their
evergreens, which grow thickly on the slopes of
what was once the inner castle moat, for there were
no less than three. No wonder Queen Maud felt
that in reaching Wallingford in safety after her
terrible escape over the frozen meadows of Oxford,
she once more held the lead in the game she and
Stephen played for the crown. Stephen, however,
was not daunted. He settled down at Crowmarsh
across the river, and made strenuous attempts to
take the fortress. After a long time, when the
garrison were beginning to despair, the Queen's
son Henry came to the rescue with a force sufficient
to afford relief. It was at Wallingford the
treaty was made which eventually secured Henry's
succession. The castle was given to Piers Gaveston
by Edward II., but after the fall of Gaveston it
reverted to the Crown. Joan, the Fair Maid of
Kent, wife of the Black Prince, died here in 1385,
and later, in the Civil Wars between King and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
Parliament, Wallingford held stoutly to the
Stuarts. The town was the last place in Berkshire
which remained to the King, and it was
taken in July, 1646, after a siege of sixty-five days.
Cromwell, therefore, cherished a grudge against it,
and when he came into power he ordered the castle
to be destroyed, an order which was unfortunately
carried out. Not far away in the same grounds is
a fragment of a ruined and ivy-grown tower. This
is part of an ancient college of St. Nicholas founded
by Edmund, second Earl of Cornwall, who died
in 1300.

<p class="caption">WALLINGFORD
</p>
</div>

<p>
In some ways Wallingford reminds one of
Abingdon. They are both homely, pleasant,
brick-built market-towns, rather sleepy, but self-respecting.
There are several islands beside the
bridge; but Wallingford has not made the most
of its islands. They are bare, and disfigured by
boat-building works. The bridge is fair, and, seen
from below, where a weeping willow falls softly
over one bank, the view is pretty. A conspicuous
feature is the steeple of the church near, looking
as if it had been joined on to the body without
any thought of continuity of style. There are
three churches in Wallingford, which once owned
fourteen! There is rather a good seventeenth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
century Town Hall in the market-place and a Corn
Exchange. Friday is the market-day. Both above
and below the town the river is pleasant, though
without original features; there are well-kept parks
and fine-grown trees to be seen frequently. The
only interesting place in the stretch below is
Mongewell, where a large piece of artificial water
joins the river, and near it is a small church
quaintly built. Shute Barrington, the well-known
Bishop of Durham, married for his second wife
the heiress of Mongewell, and lived here before
his death. Below Mongewell is a long, dull stretch,
good for boating, but too unshaded and open to
be pleasant for loiterers. The Trial Eights take
place here in December.

<img src="images/i-141.jpg" width="325" height="401" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
When two villages
stand facing
one another across
a bridge, it is inevitable
that comparisons,
however
impertinent, will
be made. And
it may be said at
once that Streatley,
for all its old
church, its pretty
hotel, and its mill,
cannot dispute
the palm with Goring, which has an older church
and a more charming mill, and many other
advantages. Streatley church is singularly vivid in
colouring. Rarely is there to be seen a deeper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
green-gold than that made by the lichen on the red
roof, and when the sunshine flashes out upon it
the effect is positively startling.
</p>

<p>
Not less attractive in its way is the red-roofed
hotel with its backing of thick, green foliage, its
tiny grass plots on the river's edge, and its gay
flowers. The flour mill would be a valuable asset
in the beauty items of any place not eclipsed by
so near a neighbour.
</p>

<p>
There are islands in the stream, and the bridge
which runs across them is singularly picturesque.
This is one of the few old wooden bridges remaining,
and it is doubtless destined soon to be replaced
by one of iron, as has been done at Pangbourne.
At this one can hardly cavil, for delightful as are
the long slender wooden piles to look at, they do
seem as if they might give way unexpectedly at
any minute.

<p class="caption">STREATLEY
</p>
</div>

<p>
If we stand down by the lock there are numberless
views in all directions, each good in itself. It
is a hot day in summer, and the vivid scarlet and
the deep carmine of the lock-keeper's geraniums
literally strike one's eyeballs with their colour.
We do not, alas! hear the wash of the water
tumbling over the weir, for weirs in summer often
run dry, or give only a small trickle, though it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
just the time when their gay music would most
appeal to the heart of man. The lock-keeper has
stories to tell of the days before the "pound"
locks, as they used to be called, were made. What
we call the weirs were then the "locks." The great
barges had to be towed up the weirs by means of
rope and capstan; and sometimes, when the water
ran low, they had to wait for weeks for a freshet
that would enable them to get up. The lock here
is only five-eighths of a mile below that at Cleeve,
and these two are the nearest together on the river,
except those of Temple and Hurley. Beyond
Cleeve there is a long stretch of six and a-half
miles before the next, Benson Lock. It almost
seems as if the powers that deal with locks had
in their justice tried to make things even by
multiplying them in the beauty spots, so that those
who want only the best have to pay for it by the
worry of passing locks; while those who are
content with something less can have it without
bother. Some locks, however, have been done
away with as unnecessary. There used to be one
between those of Cleeve and Benson, and another
at Hartslock Wood, below Goring; but these have
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The ancient road known as the Icknield Street
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
crosses the river at Streatley; it was used by the
Romans, but made long before their time.
</p>

<p>
High beyond the bridge, and, rising above it,
as we stand at the lock, is the grand sweep of hill
locally known as Greenhill, in distinction from
Whitehill on the Goring side.
</p>

<p>
To the right, on the top of the heights, are the
golf links, and the small white road winds steeply
up, carrying with it a touch of melancholy, which
the sight of a far-away and steep road always gives,
a suggestion of a journey that winds "uphill all
the way."
</p>

<p>
Reading has now established a regatta to keep
its own folk in its own neighbourhood on the
August Bank-Holiday; and a great boon this
has been to the quiet up-river places, for they are
not now invaded by launches full of rollicking,
bottle-shying crowds, such as are characteristic of
the neighbourhood of all great towns, and on these
occasions apt to become remarkably prominent.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i151" id="i151"></a>
<img src="images/i-151.jpg" width="437" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GORING CHURCH
</p>
</div>

<p>
Goring stands high among Thames villages,
literally and figuratively. Its main street runs
winding up-hill to the station, and though there
are few of the genuine old cottages left, the small
houses which have replaced them have been mostly
built in the best modern river style, with exterior
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
beams, porches, projecting windows and ornamental
gables. Creepers flourish abundantly. From the
river the church is easily seen. A small and narrow
backwater leads under a bridge to within fifty yards
of the tower.
</p>

<p>
The building is very old, and was originally the
church of the Augustinian priory. It is partly
covered with rough stucco, which is peeling off
untidily in patches. The tower is Norman, and
has a bastion turret, which greatly adds to its
appearance, and, what is more uncommon, the east
end is an apse, though we are bound in honesty
to say an apse rebuilt.
</p>

<p>
Close by the church is the mill, which eclipses that
at Streatley in appearance, and shows adaptability
in applying its power as an electric generating
station, while Streatley remains conservative, and
still grinds the sweet-scented white flour. But the
electric charging has not spoilt the mossy roof,
gleaming green and russet alternately, or the pretty
pigeon-house from which flocks of white pigeons
often sweep round over the glistening water and
the low islands. A very large and neat boat-house
lies below the bridge on the Goring side.
</p>

<p>
Between this and Pangbourne we have at first
rich well-covered heights on the one side, and high,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62'>[62]</a></span>
open chalky hills on the other, dotted with the
neat circular clumps usually associated with chalk
uplands. But after a while these are replaced
by the famous Hartslock Woods.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of the valley of the Thames between
Goring and Henley, in his introduction to the <i>Flora
of Oxfordshire</i>, Mr. G. Claridge Druce says:
</p>

<p>
"We may wander for miles through verdant
alleys whose groundwork begins in early spring
with the glossy gold of the smaller celandine, followed
by the pale stars of the wood anemones and
myriads of primroses, these giving place to sheets
of hyacinths, 'that seem the heavens upbreaking
through the earth,' the blue being here and there
relieved by the yellow archangel or brightened
with stitchwort; still later on the bluebells are
replaced by masses of the fragrant woodruff, and
these by the more sombre colouring of the bugle.
Then come the creamy-white flowers of the helleborine,
the dull, livid spikes of the bird's nest
orchis and the blue forget-me-nots, giving place
to a galaxy of summer flowers, brightening in later
months into the brilliant yellow of the ragworts and
the purple of the foxgloves. The grassy downs, too,
in spring are resplendent with the milkwort in all
its purity of colour, whether of that typical blue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
which rivals the Swiss gentian in beauty, or fading
into white or blushing to pink; while mixed with
it are brilliant patches of rich orange yellow hippocrepis.
Later on appear the rosy crimson spikes of
the pyramidal orchis and the pale lemon flowers
of lady's fingers, and the drooping blue-flowered
campanula. If perchance the land have remained
fallow, the bright flowers of iberis, sometimes suffused
with rich purple, the glaucous foliage of rare
fumarias, the deep crimson petals of the hybrid
poppy, the bright rosy pink spikes of sainfoin and
yellow toad flax, combine to form a varied show."

<p class="caption">GORING
</p>
</div>

<p>
Before reaching Pangbourne we pass acres of
osier beds on the right. Pangbourne and Whitchurch
stand to each other in the same relation
as do Goring and Streatley, but in this case it is
the southern side to which the palm must be
awarded. At Pangbourne the old wooden bridge has
given place to an iron one, but the deed has been
carried out in a manner that reflects credit on the
doer, for the new bridge runs in a graceful curve,
and its sides of latticed ironwork are painted white.
Seen in glimpses between the islands, the new
bridge does not detract from the charms of Pangbourne,
but rather adds to them.
</p>

<p>
There are numbers of islands at Pangbourne,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
and they lie in a great basin between and beneath
the weirs, which are small and frequent. The pool
is full of beauty. The trees grow freshly and well,
and throw a veil of tender green over the water,
which is, on a summer day, brilliant in hues
of blue and green, cobalt, sea-green, pale apple,
indigo; these can all be traced lying in strips and
sections where the riotous torrent from the weirs
frays out its inquietude and loses itself. In one
corner by a pretty cottage is a splash of vivid
crimson, an arcade of roses. Near the bridge
great launch works are a blot and an eyesore, but
it is so seldom we find our ointment without the
proverbial fly.

<p class="caption">PANGBOURNE FROM THE SWAN HOTEL
</p>
</div>

<p>
Pangbourne village is quaint and pleasing enough,
but it is not so beautiful as some of the villages
along the Thames side. No village built haphazard,
with a little river bridged over in its main
street, with a brick-towered church, with dark
evergreens, and a fair amount of creepers, could
fail to be attractive in some sense. But there is
too much new brick in Pangbourne. The river
Pang is a tiny streamlet, and the winding ways do
not hold that charm which can be felt even as one
races by in a motor. Further up the river a row
of neatly-built, red-brick and white-balconied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
houses stands up against a high chalk bank overlooking
the river; behind this, in a deep cutting,
runs the railway line. Above the bridge there is
a landing on the Whitchurch side close to the
church, which is a well-kept flint building. In the
chancel there is a monument to the Lybbe family,
dated 1599. Whitchurch is mostly built of red
brick, and is neat and clean, but without any very
great attractions. Before reaching Mapledurham
a fine old house, Hardwicke, is passed. Charles I.
stayed here and played bowls. The house itself
is well protected by trees, but it stands in rather
open country, amid bare chalk uplands, where
sometimes may be seen a curious opaline glow in
pale sunshine.
</p>

<p class="caption">WHITCHURCH LOCK
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mapledurham is greatly spoilt by the churlishness
of its main landlord. The lock-keeper is strictly forbidden
to ferry anyone across the river, and though
the crossing would be but short, and would involve
only a walk of a few seconds along the bank to the
mill, it is not permitted. As the nearest bridges
on each side are those of Pangbourne and Caversham,
it is necessary for anyone going by road to
keep to the north side of the river between these
points if he wants to see Mapledurham. The
place certainly is worth some trouble, but it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
small, and the restrictions are tiresome. The fine
old Elizabethan house is a real mansion of the
good old sort; one could imagine endless stories
of romance connected with it. It was fortified
during the civil wars by Sir Arthur Blount,
governor of Reading, and is still held by the same
family. The principal entrance is by an avenue
of elms nearly a mile long, but the house is perhaps
best seen through the gates from the churchyard.
The church is small, and Perpendicular in style,
with the exception of the tower, a modern addition
in flint and brick. There is within a Blount chapel
with many family memorials, including an altar-tomb.

<p>
The mill at Mapledurham is also a great delight
to look upon, and numbers of artists sketch it from
every point of view. The islands lying in the
swirl of the weir-pool afford many a quiet nook
in which to anchor, though landing is forbidden.
From this it may be judged that if Mapledurham
is a Paradise, it is sternly guarded with notices,
which meet one on every side with the persistence
of the flaming sword.

<h2>
CHAPTER VII<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
A MITRED ABBOT
</span></h2>

<p>
The Abbot of Reading was, like the Abbot of
Abingdon, mitred, and bore powerful rule. Reading
ranked third among the abbeys of England,
and held the great privilege of coining. It was
founded in 1121 by King Henry I. himself, who
was afterwards buried here. It was for long supposed
that Adeliza his queen lay here also, but the
evidence goes to show she was buried in Flanders.
The Empress Maud lies at Reading. The great
church was dedicated by Thomas à Becket, and
in it took place the marriage of John of Gaunt.
</p>

<p>
Fuller, who is always worth quoting, says that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
though Ely "bare away the bell for bountefull
feast making," Reading "spurred up close" to it,
and continues: "The mention of Reading minds
me of a pleasant and true story, which, to refresh
my wearied self and reader, after long pains, I here
intend to relate":
</p>

<p>
"King Henry VIII. as he was hunting in
Windsor forest lost himself, and struck down about
dinner-time to the Abbey of Reading, where,
disguising himself, he was invited to the abbot's
table and passed for one of the king's guard. A
sirloin of beef was set before him on which the king
laid on lustily, not disgracing one of that place for
whom he was mistaken. 'Well fare thy heart,'
quoth the abbot, 'and here in a cup of sack, I
remember the health of his Grace your master.
I would give a hundred pounds on the condition I
could feed so heartily on beef as you do. Alas, my
weak and squeasy stomach will hardly digest the
wing of a small rabbit or chicken.' The king
pleasantly pledged him, and heartily thanking him
for his good cheer, after dinner departed as undiscovered
as he came thither. Some weeks after the
abbot was sent for by a pursuivant, brought up to
London, clapped in the Tower, kept close prisoner,
fed for a short time with bread and water. Yet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
not so empty his body of food as his mind was filled
with fears, creating many suspicions to himself,
when and how he had incurred the king's displeasure.
At last a sirloin of beef was set before
him, on which the abbot fed as the farmer of his
grange, and verified the proverb that 'Two hungry
meals make the third a glutton.' In springs
King Henry out of a private lobby where he
had placed himself, the invisible spectator of the
abbot's behaviour. 'My lord,' quoth the king,
'presently deposit your hundred pounds in gold,
or else no going hence all the days of your life.
I have been your physician to cure you of your
squeasy stomach, and here, as I deserve, I demand
my fee for the same.' The abbot down with his dust,
and glad he had escaped so, returned to Reading,
as somewhat lighter in purse, so much more
merrier in heart than when he came thence."
</p>

<p>
When the Dissolution came, the abbot, full of
belief in his own strength, defied the king,
though he saw the whirlwind around him which
had devastated other monasteries no less powerful
than his own. There was no over-tenderness in
Henry's methods, and Hugh Faringford, thirty-first
was abbot, hanged, drawn and quartered in front
of his own gateway in 1539.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There is very little left of this famous abbey now,
and the gateway has been so carefully "restored"
that there is more restoration about it than anything
else; in fact, it is simply a reconstruction.
Nearly all the remains lie within a very few acres,
and the Forbury public garden is on the site of one
of the courts of the abbey. The ruins at the east
end are heavily covered with masses of ivy, but
preserve the outlines of the chapter house and
church, which was over five hundred feet in length.
</p>

Reading possessed a castle as well as an abbey,
and the castle has vanished still more completely,
leaving even its exact site unknown, though it is
supposed to have been at the west end of the
present Castle Street, or at the place where the
prison now stands.

In 871 the Danes got as far up the river as
Reading, and seized both town and castle. Many
times has parliament been held in the ancient
town, and many sovereigns have visited Reading,
including Queen Elizabeth, who stayed there no
less than six times. In the civil wars Reading was
a stronghold for the king until, after a severe siege,
in 1653 the garrison capitulated on condition of
being allowed to walk out free with arms and baggage,
a boon which was granted. After this the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
place was held by the Parliamentarians, but was
again occupied for the king, only to become once
again the headquarters of the Parliamentary army,
and so it had many changes of fortune. St. Giles's
church still bears the marks of the artillery from
which it suffered during those uncertain times.
There are other churches in Reading, but this is
not a guide book, so there is no need to enumerate
them. Archbishop Laud was born in Reading,
and educated at the Free School. Reading is not
actually on the river, and Caversham may be called
its river-suburb. It is not a place which much
attracts boating men. From its size, its manufactories,
its chimneys, it is necessarily in many
aspects unpleasant to those who have come to seek
their rest and pleasure far from smoke and toil.
The most important industries are Messrs. Sutton's
seed emporium, and Messrs. Huntley and Palmer's
biscuit factory, which employs more than five
thousand persons; there are also breweries and
many lesser works. Did it not lie between two
such pre-eminently charming places as Sonning
and Mapledurham, boating people would avoid it
altogether.

<p>
There are certain
notable details of
the river-side
which stand out
in the mind after
the rest have been
merged in mere
general remembrance
of lazy
happiness. In
these we may include
the backwater
at Sutton
Courtney, the
woods at Clieveden, the Mill at Mapledurham,
and the Rose Garden at Sonning. Roses grow
well all along by the river, but nowhere so
well as they do at Sonning, and the rose
garden forms an attraction which draws hundreds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
to the place. Yet Sonning has other attractions
too; it is very varied and very pretty.
When one arrives at it first, perhaps coming
upstream, one is rather perplexed to discover the
exact topography. We round a great curve which
encloses an osier bed; here, in early spring, the
osiers may be seen lying in great bundles, shaded
from olive-green to brown madder. Then we see
some green lawns and landing places beneath the
shadow of a fine clump of elms, and catch sight of
the lovable old red-brick bridge, with its high centre
arch, spanning the stream. But there is another
bridge, a wooden foot-bridge, which also spans the
stream, at right angles to the other, and peering
through beneath this, we can see the continuation
of the red brick one in a new iron structure, which
stretches on right up to the neat flower beds of the
French Horn Hotel. The truth is, the river suddenly
widens out here into a great bulge, and in
the bulge are several islands, on one of which are
a mill and a house and several other things, not to
forget a charming garden. It is the river channel
between this island and the bank that the first
bridge, the old one, spans. And what a view it is!
Above the bridge can be seen rising the little grey
church tower. On one side is the White Hart
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
Hotel, with its warm tone of yellow wash, its red
tiles and its creepers, and above all its famous rose
garden. In the foreground is a willow-covered ait
placed in exactly the right position. It is a perfect
picture. But yet this is not the best side of the
bridge. The other side is better; for here, to resist
the flow of the current, the builders placed the
buttresses which emphasise the height of that
centre arch; buttresses now capped with tufty
grass and emerald moss, and from the crevices of
which spring clumps of yellow daisies, candytuft,
wallflower, hart's-tongue fern, and other things. In
the bricks all colours may be seen, after the manner
of worn bricks, not even excluding blue. The
mill is, as it should be, wooden, and with Sandford
Mill, is mentioned in Domesday Book. From the
dark shadow beneath its wheel, the largest on the
river, gurgles away the water in cool green streams,
passing beneath the overhanging boughs of planes
and horse-chestnuts. From the mighty sweep of
the wheel, as it may be seen in its house, the drops
rise glittering in cascades to varying heights like
the sprays of diamonds on a tiara. The mill-house,
called Aberlash, stands not far off on the same
island, with a delightful garden.

<p class="caption">THE ROSE GARDEN AT SONNING
</p>
</div>

<p>
This island spreads onward with green lawns in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
sweeping semicircle to the lock and cottage, and
from two small weirs the water dances down,
adding variety to a beautiful pool where stand
many irregular pollard willows on tiny aits. Over
the smaller weir, framed in a setting of evergreens,
is a bit of far distant blue landscape. There is a
bank here too, an embankment, which might be
covered with flowers according to its owner's design,
but that the water nymphs, intolerant of flowers,
except those of their own choosing, take a wicked
delight in sweeping down over the weir, and
sending the water flowing like a lace shawl all over
the embankment to carry back all the roots and
bulbs and other things that may have been planted
there to use as playthings; their gurgle of delight
at their own unending joke may be heard all day
long.
</p>

<p>
The shy kingfishers love the big pool below
the weir, but it is not often they are seen unless
the watcher has the faculty for making himself
invisible against his background and is able to
remain motionless.
</p>

<p>
The woods of the Holme Park, rising high close
by, throw a deep-toned shadow on the picture,
particularly refreshing on a baking summer's day.
Many birds find their refuge in these woods, and at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
night the weird cries of the owls sound hauntingly
over the flats. A ghost is supposed to inhabit the
park, and the owl's cry might very well serve for a
ghost's moan on occasion.
</p>

<p>
Having thus explored the puzzling bit of river,
we may land and walk up through the Rose
Garden, or, according to Mr. Ashby Sterry in his
<i>Lays of a Lazy Minstrel</i>:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>
With this brilliant mass of colour, the rich dark
reds, the glorious pinks, the pale yellows, dead
whites and the flaming apricot of William Allen
Richardson, the effect may be imagined; and the
entry to all this beauty is beneath a trellised arch
covered with masses of the Crimson Rambler!
</p>

<p>
Sonning village itself is very irregular, uphill and
downhill, with roads all ways. There are rights of
way through the quiet churchyard, where there is
a row of magnificent elms, and the villagers are
real flower lovers. Almost at any season of the
year at which flowers will flourish out of doors,
flowers there are to be seen. Earliest of all, the
quince, the yellow jasmine, and the dainty almond
blossom; then the golden bunches of laburnum
and the fresh mauve lilac; later on roses of all
kinds, not always climbing, but in bushes and
clumps. Window boxes are seen everywhere, and
Virginia creeper and ampelopsis cover up all bare
corners. The houses themselves are charming.
There are many more cottages in the older style
than can be found at Wargrave. Many a tiny
diamond-paned window is seen high up, almost lost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>[78]</a></span>
in a straggling creeper. The projecting storeys,
the brown lathes imbedded deep in the brick,
making rectangles of broken colour, the yellow
wash of a deep umber, the high external chimneys,
all make up many nooks to be looked at again and
again with appreciation. Sydney Smith was staying
at Sonning in 1807, and we can but admire his
taste.
</p>

<p>
There is a tradition, very hazy, that Sonning was
once the seat of a bishopric. There is no evidence
at all as to this, but the fact that the See of Salisbury
has held the manor since the time when
Domesday Book was made may have led to the
error.
</p>

<p>
The bishops had a house here, and it was at the
bishops' house that King John stayed for six days
a month before his death. Leland says: "And
yet remaineth a faire olde House there of stone,
even by the Tamise Ripe longging to the Bishop
of Saresbyri, and thereby is a fine Park."
</p>

<p>
The oldest parts of the church probably date
from 1180, but there is very little of this date left.
The principal bits are the south doorway and a
small window above it. The south aisle was built
about 1350, the piers of the nave about 1400, at
which date the chancel was added. The north
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>
chancel aisle and the north aisle came about 100
years later. The whole church was restored in
1852. There are one or two interesting monuments
to be seen in it, and it is a good model of
what a well-preserved, dignified parish church
should be.

<h2>
CHAPTER IX<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
WARGRAVE AND NEIGHBOURHOOD
</span></h2>

<p>
Wargrave is one of the most delightful of
Thames-side villages. There is not much that is
old among the houses that line the village street;
thatch has almost gone. Wooden beams are not
noticeable, except when used in the modern
architecture that imitates the old; the material
seen everywhere is red brick. Wind and weather,
however, soon tone down the asperities of red brick,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>[81]</a></span>
and from the rich soil creepers spring up quickly
to cover it with loving tendrils; so the street
becomes a delightful medley of casement windows,
gable ends, and bushy foliage. Not the least of
the charm is that each small house has its own
ideas about frontage, and entirely refuses to stand
in line with the rest. There are houses with their
doorsteps in the roadway, and houses modestly
retiring behind bushes in their strip of garden.
Here is a wistaria with a stem as thick as a
man's arm, and there roses and sweetbriar, purple
clematis and starry jasmine, succeeding and intermingling.
Wargrave has learnt to choose the
good and refuse the evil of the modern spirit;
she is clean and self-respecting as some villages
will never learn to be. Her small shops are good
of their kind, but self-conscious she is not, or
garish, or any other of the horrible things associated
with modernity.
</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="i201" id="i201"></a>
<img src="images/i-201.jpg" width="550" height="437" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CHURCH AT WARGRAVE
</p>
</div>

<p>
The place centres about cross roads, but straggles
in many directions, and on the high ground
surrounding it many a new house has been built
lately, and stands amid delightful grounds.
</p>

<p>
The church, which is near the open green,
where grow fine trees, is of flint, with a red-brick
pinnacled tower, half ivy-covered. In the church
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
is buried Thomas Day, author of <i>Sandford and
Merton</i>, who was killed by a fall from his horse
in 1789. A Norman doorway, a carved oak
pulpit black with age, and a huge family pew, tell
of long survival, and give the church the same
touch of self-respecting dignity that the village
has. It can be seen from the water, peeping over
greenery near a backwater, with its tower overtopped
by trees.
</p>

<p>
The whole of Wargrave is seen to advantage
from the water or from the meadows opposite.
Many green lawns slope down to the brink, and
the height of the bushy elms is a thing to note.
A few Lombardy poplars break the fulness of
the bosky foliage with their elongated ovals, and
that most graceful of all trees, the wych elm,
curves his beautiful lines in soft arches over the
velvety lawns or smoothly-flowing water.
</p>

<p>
The river turns almost a right angle at Wargrave,
and, from running eastward, goes due north.
The little village, being situated at the bend, gets
the benefit of both vistas. The George Hotel,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
indeed, stands exactly at the angle, and the
sweep of the water catches its wharf with full
force. It boasts a signboard painted by two
R.A.s; this is preserved indoors, while another
swings as its proxy in the village street. Placed
as it is in regard to the river channel, and with
the wide flats of Shiplake meadows opposite,
the hotel is exposed, and the very openness of
its garden, an attraction which draws hundreds
of summer visitors, makes it a butt for the racing
winds of early spring. It is a pretty hotel built
of brick, with a white painted verandah, after
the usual river pattern; and a gigantic wistaria
embowers all the front in its delicate mauve in
summer, while roses trained over trellis work
flash answering colour signals.
</p>

<p>
The view over the river includes the glowing
sunsets, which leave a slowly dying splendour
behind a distant bank of trees.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>
Looking up to the left is the railway bridge,
which is not so ugly as it might be; below, every
hundred yards shows fresh beauties.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Wargrave backwater is one of the most noted
on the river, and in summer, or early spring, is
a fairyland of greenery. The entrance is behind
the large willow-covered island that lies below
the hotel. The tiny arched bridge, not far in,
is so low that one has to lie full length in a
boat in order to pass under it. This is called
Fiddler's bridge, though no local tradition keeps
alive the origin of the name. The gentle light
shimmers down between the spear-leaved willows
in a veil of glory, and the stream is so narrow,
one can almost touch the banks with both hands
at once. In the main stream meantime, there are
several islands decorated with the new rough
stuccoed houses now so popular in river architecture,
and, at the end where the backwater
emerges again, there is a brightly-coloured boat-house.
Beyond this, again, is a long stretch where
there are generally house-boats. In winter, a little
creek on the left bank is a kind of storehouse for
them. This is a fine wide reach, and above it
rises Wargrave Hill with its large white house
conspicuously placed.
</p>

<p>
Further down, the river makes a succession of
curves; and facing up stream is Bolney Court, in
a solid, old-fashioned style, of a dull yellow colour,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
while, behind and around it, the deep blue-green
of Scotch firs is seen among the lighter foliage,
and on the curving heights which block the vista
to the north, the heights above Henley, these
trees are conspicuous everywhere. Indeed, evergreens
of all kinds flourish well in the chalky
soil about Wargrave.
</p>

<p>
The late C. J. Cornish said somewhere that
Thames eyots always seem to have been put in
place by a landscape gardener, and those about
Bolney recall the words. They are thickly grown
over by sedge and osiers, and overshadowed by taller
trees; between them, the channels of shining water,
half hidden half revealed, gain all the charm of
elusiveness. Has anyone ever reflected what a
kindly thought it was of Nature's, to arrange
that trees growing on the water's edge should
invariably take an outward angle, so as to lean
over the water? How much less effective the
result would have been had they grown inward,
may be pictured by imagining a river without
reflections. In the stillness of a backwater, or
in the narrowed channel beside a large island,
the beautiful effect of this outward angle is
best seen. If the channel be very narrow, the
trunks fold one behind the other in perspective,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'>[86]</a></span>
so as to form an arch over a shining aisle. In
the water, all the many-coloured gnarled stems
are smoothed by the gentle movement into something
softer than the rigid reality, with its hard
knots of shadow. The different colouring on
the stems of the same species of tree is a thing
to marvel at. From the deep mahogany of a joint
where the damp has made an open wound, to
the faint biscuit-colour of the place where a strip
of bark has been newly peeled off, the stems of
pollarded willows furnish every brown and yellow
on a painter's palette. Many of them are richly
crowned by a head of ivy, whose satin-smooth leaves
fall in garlands like locks, and sway with every
touch of air. These are reflected in the water
as a shaded mass of green with no detail.
</p>

<p>
There are so many varieties of willow that it
is difficult for the lay mind to remember them
all, and numbers of them are to be seen about
Wargrave. It is the Crack willow and the White
willow, with long slender leaves, that are commonly
pollarded as osiers, though they will grow tall
enough if they are allowed to. There is a legend
that the mournful droop of the leaves of the
weeping willow is a reminiscence of the sad time
of the Captivity:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, when we remembered thee, O Sion;
</p>
<p>
As for our harps, we hanged them up upon the willow trees that grow therein.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Besides the willows, there are their cousins, the
poplars, chief among which, is the fine Populus
tremula, whose leaves whisper perpetual secrets,
even on the stillest days. This is caused by the
broad leaves being attached to a slender flattened
stalk. They are silky on the wrong side, and when
the wind blows through the foliage it turns a soft
greyish white, like a cottony mass. There is a
legend that the wood of this tree was used for
the Cross, and that in consequence it has trembled
ever since, and so its leaves are in a perpetual state
of quivering.
</p>

<p>
The poplar, like the ash, is not kind to
neighbouring trees, its numerous suckers taking
more than their share of nourishment and moisture
from the ground, and the leaves, when they fall,
seem to be as destructive as those of the beech,
for grass will not grow where they lie.
</p>

<p>
In spring, these trees shed their long catkins,
like hairy caterpillars, all over the water, and
they are swept up in heaps into every eddy.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the delights of summer, there is a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
time which well bears comparison with it; I mean
the first fine days of early spring, before the rest
of the world has awakened to the fact that winter
is over. And about Wargrave at such times there
is to be found great charm by those whose senses
are alert. It is true that the splendid hedge
that lines the tow-path shows only the long
withes of the creepers and no starry flowers; that
the graceful sprays of the wild rose now appear
barbed and polished and ferocious, instead of
sweet and enticing. A bush of barberry or
berberis is not often seen in hedges, for the old
folk-lore taught that wheat never throve when
the barberry was in the hedge; therefore the
farmers grubbed it up whenever they found it.
But science has confirmed the empirical wisdom
of our fathers, for it was discovered that the
barberry furnishes the intermediate host for rust
in wheat. On the green river bank there are
quivering blades of tender green, but no flowers
with their umbrella heads of white, or bunchy
yellow, or pale mauve. Yet still there are
compensations. To begin with, the river itself
talks in spring as it never does in summer, and
what is better, one can hear it without the
interruption of human chatter or noise. One has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
the whole stretch to one's self, and attuning one's
ear to the key of that conversation, one can
listen to it sucking at the bank, flop-flopping
under the prow of one's punt, chuckling as it races
past the pole, and, laughing a little silvery laugh
of merriment, that we call rippling&mdash;a word we
have learnt to adapt to our poor human attempts
in the same direction. The river sprites are with
us, and very busy they are&mdash;ceaselessly busy about
nothing at all, and so happy in their activity that
to hear them is to laugh for right good fellowship.
The wind is in the water, urging them on faster
and faster; each wavelet has its crest of foam,
and, in the heights and hollows ahead there is
every shade of green, from emerald to olive. One
must be very still in order to imbibe the real
spirit of the scene, for they are shy, these river
nymphs, as shy as the birds and beasts that live
around them, and have learned the fear of tempestuous
man. A shy-bold wren, with a sudden
glint of sunlight on his rich brown back, flies
to the edge of the water where the punt lies
drifting, and then darts back in haste to the
shelter of that commanding hedge he never
likes to leave. His pertness is all in his appearance;
never did looks so belie a timid character!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>[90]</a></span>
A water-hen, startled by the sudden dip of the
pole, flies out of the reeds close by, and skims
in a swift low line to the islet opposite; her
smooth dark body, with the elongated neck and
scant tail, resembles an Eastern water skin.
</p>

<p>
There is a gentle continuous whispering among
the reeds, as if they questioned themselves, with
quiet disapprobation, why the river was always
in such a hurry. From the field behind the hedge
comes the sweet scream of a wheeling peewit, and
two large wood-pigeons flap noisily from the tall
trees on the island, a very picture of contented
domesticity.
</p>

<p>
We slide on gently, close by the tow-path, until
the tall hedge comes to an end, and the green
meadows stretch right away from the lip of the
river, and around them rise the tree-crowned
heights in a semicircle, like the tiers of a giant
amphitheatre.

Flop! A water rat dives furtively. Though
called a rat, he is in reality a vole, and is almost
exclusively graminivorous; in this differing from
his namesake, the real rat, which also haunts river
banks, especially near mills. With hoarse squawk,
a wild duck rises heavily from cover, and after
the first difficult spiral, wings off like an arrow,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
his long neck extended. It is a day of cloud
and shadow, and suddenly the light breaks out
on the trees ahead with a wild freshness that
makes one catch one's breath. It races up
stream, and the dun is turned to gold at the
touch of its breath. The sweetness of early
spring is in the air and in our blood; the larks
feel it as they rise:

<p>
And there is a stirring of sap and juice in things&mdash;small
things deep down in dark holes and corners,
and in all green and growing things.
</p>

<p>
After this, how cloying the richness of summer,
with its still days, its glaring reflections, the
luscious foliage, and the overpowering scents&mdash;the
thought of it strikes one's senses as the
thought of a hothouse would strike a child of the
moor and the mountain. And when we remember
Wargrave regatta, with its crowded banks, its
lined shores, its flags a-flutter, and its noise, we
are thankful that August is afar off.
</p>

<p>
Though we have wandered down stream, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
bit above Wargrave is equally attractive. Just
beyond the railway bridge the river Loddon flows
into the Thames. To pass up it and its tributary,
St. Patrick's stream, is no easy feat; yet by using
this loop the lock may be evaded, and it is the
only place on the river where such a trick is
possible. It is, however, far the best to explore
this by-way from the other end and to come
down stream by its means. To reach it, one must
go high up above the lock, beyond the last of
the chain of islands which here breaks the channel,
and there turn in under a small bridge, into this
curious tributary, which starts from the river and
returns to it again. It flows at first through
wide flat meadows, and then bifurcates, one
branch, blocked by a weir, communicating again
with the Thames, and the other falling into the
Loddon, and with it rejoining the main river.
</p>

<p>
Part of St. Patrick's stream is fringed by
well-grown uniform pollard willows that hedge
it like a wall. In summer, when the meadows
are rich in buttercups, and the wind hums softly
over the clover, bringing wafts of scent, and
many a quaint weed adds its note of colour to
the general harmony, it is very charming. But
the most delightful feature is the growth of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
Leucojum æstivum, or summer snowflake, which
is so numerous that it is popularly known as the
Loddon lily. This is like a large snowdrop in
which several blooms spring from one head. It is
also to be found on several of the islands in the
main river near, but is not abundant there. The
Loddon itself rises far inland: Twyford gets its
name from lying near two branches, a twy-ford.
The stream is slow, and it is only the swift current
of St. Patrick that enlivens it lower down.
</p>

<p>
Above the mouth of the Loddon there lies an
interesting bit of the river. On a large island,
owned by the Corporation of London, stands the
lock-keeper's cottage, and opposite to it, on the
mainland, a delightful old mill-house with tiled
roof, and that weather-worn, rather battered
appearance, which all self-respecting mill-houses
aim at as the perfection of ripeness. The long
tongue of the lock island projects down stream
like the nose of a pike. In winter, the little
moorhens, partly tamed by hunger, and reassured
by the absence of those noisy humans who come
in such numbers in warmer weather, run about
all over it. Other things run too, all the year
round; the lock-keeper has a fine stock of hens,
but accepts philosophically the fact that he can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
never rear any chickens "because of the rats."
The rats, which are attracted by the ample stores
at the mill-house, and find such variety of
lodgings along the banks of the stream and in
the crevices of the much worn woodwork, are the
pest of these places.
</p>

<p>
The island is a popular camping ground, and
the pitches are generally secured early in the
season, having been well prepared beforehand by
being laid in sand and flints to ensure a dry
foundation. There are also a tiny bungalow, to
be had for two guineas the week, and a bathing
place available. Altogether a very attractive
island. The main stream races over the weir,
forming a wide tumbling pool below, and on the
other side of the island there is a pleasant stretch
down to the lock. These lock channels are
among some of the most charming places on
the river. They are generally very still, with the
mass of water hardly moving. On some days
every twig is reflected, and the view in this
particular one is well worth looking at, as, with
the group of the mill buildings rising high on
one side, and the cottage with its accompaniment
of standard roses on the other, there are the
elements of a most satisfactory composition.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
The meadows slope down at just that angle that
shows them off to the best advantage; they are
dotted with fine trees and are crowned by clumps
of wood, from which sounds the homely cawing
of rooks. The red cows stand knee-deep in the
placid water, lashing at the flies with their tails;
and on the other side is a mass of greenery:

Shiplake stands high above the flat meadows
by the river bank. The little flint church, in which
Tennyson was married, has a prettily buttressed
tower, and around it grow many tall evergreens
and waving trees. There are also some interesting
old frescoes on the walls, two representing
St. Christopher, who seems particularly appropriate
in a river church. From the porch, down between
two rows of shrubs, one can look on to the top
of a mass of trees, which shuts out a bend of
the silver river, and beyond them see the blue

whose book on Shiplake was privately printed,
suggests that the name originated in schiff-laacken,
for the story goes that when the Danes got so
far, their boats stuck on the shoals, and their commander
ordered them to be burnt, to prevent a
possibility of retreat.

HENLEY REGATTA

<img src="images/i-219.jpg" width="323" height="407" alt="" />

<p>
Who can ever
think of Henley
without its regatta?
And yet
Henley is very
well worth thinking
of at all times
of the year. It is
a pleasantly-built,
middle-aged, red-brick
town. Its
history does not
reach back so far
as that of Abingdon
or Reading. It boasts neither abbey nor
cathedral. Near the esplanade above the bridge,
there are one or two of the tumble-down, out-of-perpendicular
style of cottages, which invariably
add so much to a river scene; but the main
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>
part of the town, which is, of course, of red
brick, has a homely air of the seventeenth
century about it. The solid and stately Red
Lion Hotel, close to the bridge, is one of the
most historic houses in the place. Charles I.
stayed here in 1632, when, after severe dissensions,
he was trying the method of ruling England without
a Parliament, and when the terrible fate that
was to befall him had not yet "cast its shadow
before." It is doubtful if he paid his bills, for
he was in chronic want of money; but he left
a memento behind him which has more than
repaid the hotel, for it forms a perennial source of
interest. This is a large fresco painting of the
royal monogram and coat of arms over one of
the mantelpieces, and from the date it is evident it
was done at the time of this visit. It was not
discovered till 1889, having probably been hastily
concealed during the troublous days of Cromwell's
ascendency. Being on one of the principal coaching
roads, Henley received more than its share of
celebrated visitors. On July the 12th, 1788,
George III., with the Queen and three of
his daughters, had breakfast at the Red Lion;
George IV. once dined here; and the celebrated
Duke of Marlborough regularly kept a room here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
that he might use it in his journeys from Blenheim;
his bed is still preserved. After these associations,
that of Shenstone, who wrote a poem with a
diamond on a window-pane, comes as an anticlimax.
The poem begins:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
To thee, fair Freedom, I retire,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  From flattery, cards, and dice, and din;
</p>
<p>
Nor art thou found in mansions higher
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Than the low cott or humble inn.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
And the last verse, which is often quoted, runs:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Whoe'er has travell'd life's dull round,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Whate'er his stages may have been,
</p>
<p>
May sigh to think he still has found
</p>
<p class="i1">
  The warmest welcome at an inn.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
In summer the red brick of the hotel is almost
hidden by the creepers which embrace it; especially
noticeable is the glorious wistaria, most lovely of
all the climbing plants.
</p>

<p class="caption">RED LION HOTEL, HENLEY
</p>
</div>

<p>
The bridge was built in 1786, and is of stone.
The keystones of the central arch are adorned with
sculptured masks of Thame and Isis. They were
the work of Mrs. Damer, a cousin of Horace
Walpole's, and as such falling within the limits of
the great man's kindly appreciation. Behind the
hotel and well seen from the bridge, is the church,
with its four corner pinnacles.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the regatta, and for some weeks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>
before, it is impossible to get accommodation in
the town anywhere. Of all the river regattas
Henley is by far the greatest, and comes even
before the Boat Race in the estimation of some
people. The races used to end at the bridge, and
so the lawn of the Red Lion was in the position of
a favoured grand-stand, but now the winning post
is a quarter of a mile short of this, opposite the
last villa on the left bank. The starting point is
near Temple or Regatta Island, and the reach
certainly makes a fine one for the purpose. The
course is railed off by piles and booms, and all the
hundreds of craft which gather to the scene have
to cram themselves in somehow, so as not to cause
obstruction. It is well not to select an outrigged
boat for such an occasion. The best and most
commonly seen craft are punts, worked by means
of canoe paddles; for the punts are too solid to
collapse easily in the pressure that may be put
upon them, and the paddles, requiring little room
to work, are less dangerous to one's neighbours than
poles. But all kinds of skiffs and canoes appear, and
some are even bold enough to tempt fate in Canadian
canoes. On a brilliant day, when the light
sparkles on the water, and there is enough wind
to set the pennons and streamers flying, the scene
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>
is undeniably gay and pretty. All the luncheon
tents on the green lawns near form a bright
adjunct. Salter and Talboys, from Oxford, and
other boat-builders, have landing-stages for the
week, and the various clubs entertain largely.
Chief among these is the Leander, whose fine
club-house is on the right bank not far from the
bridge; it also has a lawn further down. Not
far off are the grand-stand, the Grosvenor, and
the New Oxford and Cambridge Clubs, and one
large lawn is taken as a clubland <i>pied-à-terre</i>
for the use of any members of London clubs in
general. But beside these there are the Isthmian,
Sports, and Bath Clubs on the left bank, and
Phyllis Court, with smooth lawns; and then a long
line of house-boats begins, continuing past Fawley
Court on to Temple Island, with just one break for
the lawns of the Court. Bands play, luncheons are
consumed, flags flutter; everyone is gay and lively,
and the scene is one that can hardly be described
justly in mere word painting. At noon the first
race is rowed. A bell is rung to clear the course.
All sorts of boats and canoes have slipped out
between the openings left for them, and they must
hurry back and crush into the already tightly
wedged mass; in a moment everything else is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
forgotten in the excitement of the special event.
On the last evening of the regatta there is a grand
firework display and a procession of illuminated
boats; and, as may very well be guessed, the real
success of Henley depends greatly upon the
weather, which, even in the first week of July,
when it takes place, is not always kind.

<p class="caption">HENLEY REGATTA
</p>
</div>

<p>
As we have said, the surroundings of Henley
are of a sort to attract attention, even without the
additional glories of the regatta. Above the bridge
is a long ait, and high on the right bank rise the
woods of Park Place. Here the brilliant green of
the beeches is diversified by the dark blue-greens
of fir and cedar. The Place was once the residence
of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the grounds
were greatly improved by Field-Marshal Conway,
a cousin of Horace Walpole. A long glade is cut
through the wood. It runs under a bridge made
of blocks of stone taken from Reading Abbey,
and over this passes the road. From the river a
peep of the striking vista can be had. Higher
up again is Marsh Lock.
</p>

<img src="images/i-235.jpg" width="550" height="445" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HAMBLEDEN
</p>
</div>

<p>
But the influence of Henley extends down as
well as up the river. Phyllis and Fawley Courts
both at one time belonged to Bulstrode Whitelocke.
Fawley was wrecked very early in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
civil wars; but Phyllis was strongly fortified, and
some of the earthworks may still be seen. Henley
was a Parliamentarian stronghold, and was annoyed
by the neighbourhood of plucky little Greenlands
at Hambleden, which, "for a little fort, was made
very strong for the King."
</p>

<p>
It belonged in the time of the Stuarts to Sir
Cope d'Oyley, who was a staunch Royalist. When
he died his eldest son held Greenlands for the
King, and his house was battered by the cannon
of the Parliamentarians from across the water. In
the nineteenth century the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith
lived here, and his widow took from the village the
title he himself never lived to enjoy. In Hambleden
also there is a fine old manor house, and
some of the clipped yews in the gardens of
private houses are very remarkable. High above
the place rise the woods near Fingest and Stokenchurch.
The weirs at Hambleden are the most
attractive on the river. Long curved bridges run
across them from shore to shore, and are open
to the public as a right-of-way. The curves strike
off at different angles, and every moment the point
of view changes. Whether we are passing over
tumbling weirs, where the water glides across long
mossy planes, or over sluice-gates where it bursts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
through, the enchantment is the same. Flags and
tall yellow irises and the greenest of green tufts
grow in the water and about the foundations of
the bridges. Looking back at the mill, we see it
reflected in the calm, deep water above the weirs
as in a polished looking-glass. There are old cedars
and red-roofed cottages, and plenty of Scotch firs
and yew hedges in the background. Away up the
river is the white mass of Greenlands with its
pierced look-out tower.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER XI<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
THE ROMANCE OF BISHAM AND HURLEY
</span></h2>

<p>
One of the greatest calumnies I ever heard
expressed was the remark, "What, writing a
book about the river! Why, the river is all alike,
isn't it?" It is true that many reaches of the river
are so exceedingly attractive that there is a danger
of applying the adjectives "pretty" and "beautiful"
and "charming" to many of them, but the sameness
is not in the reaches, it is in the poverty of
one's own language. What can be more different,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
for instance, than the river about Maidenhead and
the river above Marlow? Yet both are delightful.
The patrons of the Maidenhead part no doubt
outnumber those of Bisham and Hurley, but that
is because Maidenhead is one of the most accessible
places on the river. The station at Marlow is
on a branch, and many a weary hour must be
spent waiting, if one is dependent on trains. This
is the only station for Hurley and Bisham, unless
we go on equally far in the other direction to
Henley. However, this is one of the reasons why
the Marlow section is preferable to the Maidenhead
one&mdash;when you do get there.
</p>

<p>
Great Marlow itself is a fairly important place
for a riverside village. It is like a little country
town, and though many new red-brick villas are
springing up, it could not be called "residential"
in the way that the word could be applied to
Richmond, for instance. The ground plan is very
simple. One wide street runs straight down to the
bridge, and another street crosses it at the top.
In the latter is to be found Marlow's chief literary
association, for here still stands the cottage where
Shelley lived. It is marked by a tablet, and is a
low, long building, creeper-covered, and is now
divided into several cottages. Here he wrote
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
<i>The Revolt of Islam</i> and <i>Alastor, or the Spirit of
Solitude</i>.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i243" id="i243"></a>
<img src="images/i-243.jpg" width="550" height="435" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GENERAL VIEW OF MARLOW
</p>
</div>

<p>
Down by the water side the whole aspect of
Marlow is bright and open. It must be entirely
different from the older Marlow, when the wooden
bridge&mdash;which crossed the river lower down than
the present one&mdash;and the old church were still
in existence. At present, in the summer all is
gay and clean looking. The suspension bridge,
which is the best of the modern sort of bridges
from an artist's point of view, is rather low over
the water; standing on it one can look right down
on to the green lawn of the Compleat Angler
Hotel, and see the many-coloured muslins, the
white flannels, the gay cushions, the awnings,
and the sunshades, as if they were all a gigantic
flower bed. The red hotel itself is from this
point caught against the background of the
Quarry Woods. Opposite to it is the very green
strip of the churchyard coming right down to
the edge of the river, and only separated from
it by a low stone parapet: weeping willows fling
their green spray out over the water, and behind
is the church. It is undeniable that the materials
used in the church are distinctly ugly, but the
steeple goes some way towards redeeming it,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>
and if it can be seen silhouetted, so that the
materials are lost in dimness, and only the outlines
are apparent, it becomes at once more than
passable. Spires are not common in Thames-side
churches, which are far more often capped by
rather low battlemented towers.
</p>

<p>
One of the glories of Marlow is its weir. It
runs in a great semicircular sweep below the
hotel; and, from a terrace there, one can look
right down into the swirling water; or by coming
up the backwater below in a boat, one can land
at the hotel without facing the lock at all, a great
advantage. The weir is in several planes, and
the extended flood makes a perpetual wash,
rising to a roar in winter, and dwindling to
the merest tinkle in summer. Marlow is distinctly
a summer place: its openness, its many trees, its
wide reach of water, and the splash of the weir
are all summer accompaniments; and in winter,
when the wind sweeps down from the south,
the unprotected side, and the water hisses and
bubbles in its struggle to get down to lower
levels, it is weird and melancholy.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i249" id="i249"></a>
<img src="images/i-249.jpg" width="550" height="451" alt="" />
<p class="caption">QUARRY WOODS
</p>
</div>

<p>
The lock channel is fringed by several islets,
and there is the usual mill, and a pretty wooden
foot-bridge. Several of the most graceful of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
our trees, the dainty silver birch, stand near the
mill. On some of the lower islands osiers grow,
and there are one or two neat boat-houses. Wide
meadows fringe the river below; and eastward&mdash;the
bridge lies due north and south&mdash;are the
famous Quarry Woods, held by many to be
superior even to the Clieveden Woods. In some
points they are, and not the least of these is
that they are traversed by several roads, while
those at Clieveden are kept strictly private. The
woods are composed almost wholly of beech, the
tree that loves the chalk, here so abundant, and
only a few patches of larch may be seen in
clumps among them. Beginning at the water's
edge, rising above the curious white castle with
harled walls called Quarry Hill, now to let, the
woods continue in a straight line inland, getting
further and further from the river as they go.
It is difficult to say at what season of the year
they are the most beautiful. In early spring,
before the buds burst, if looked at in the mass,
there is to be seen a kind of purple bloom made
by the myriad buds, which is not found in any
mixed woods. In spring the buds burst out into
that tender indescribable green, like nothing
else in the world, and the new-born leaves,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>[110]</a></span>
suspended from their dark and almost invisible
twigs, are for all the world like fronds of giant
maidenhair. In the autumn the whole ground is
one blaze of rich burnt-sienna, a carpet of leaves
laid so industriously that not a speck of the
bare brown earth appears; and from this rise
the stems smooth and straight, lichen-covered
every one, and thus transformed to brilliant
emerald. Where the light strikes through the
rapidly thinning branches, they have the very
glow of the stones themselves. It is an enchanted
wood, and at any moment a wizard might peep
out from behind one of those magic trunks.

<p class="caption">BISHAM CHURCH
</p>
</div>

<p>
The woods alone would be sufficient to give
Marlow a high rank among river places. But all
this is below the bridge, and above there is much
to see. Not far off, on the right bank of the
river, is Bisham, a tiny village with its church
and abbey, now a dwelling house. The whole
of Bisham is well worth lingering over. The
cottages stand along the road in straggling fashion,
old and new, and some of the gardens are bright
with homely, sweet-scented flowers, among which,
stocks and sweet-williams seem to be the
favourites in the summer. One tumble-down row,
rather off the road, is a mass of honeysuckle, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>[111]</a></span>
roses and ivy. The little church stands so near to
the margin of the river that not a dozen yards
separate its tower from the flood. A low moss-grown
stone parapet edges the churchyard; over
this elms dip their crooked boughs in a vain
endeavour to touch the ripples as they spring
playfully upward, driven by the wind. The little
church has a square stone tower, wonderfully
softened, so that it looks as if it must fray to
powder at a touch. The brick battlements are a
later addition, but the gentle river air has breathed
on them so that they tone in harmoniously. Some
of the windows are transition Norman. For ages
the little church has stood there looking out across
the water to the green flat meadows, and though
it has been rebuilt and altered, there is much of it
that is fairly ancient. The Hoby chapel was
built about 1600, by the disconsolate widow of
Sir Thomas Hoby, Ambassador to France; in it
are several fine tombs, and on that of Sir Thomas,
his lady, who was learned, as it was the fashion
for great ladies to be in her time, wrote long
inscriptions in Latin and Greek and English; the
last of which ends up with:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
"Give me, O God, a husband like unto Thomas,
</p>
<p>
Or else restore me to my husband Thomas!"
</p>
</div></div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Eight years later she married again, so that
she had presumably found a husband "like unto
Thomas." The Hoby window in this chapel, with
its coat of arms, is especially interesting, and when
the morning sun streams through in tones of
purple and gold upon the worn stones, the effect
is striking.
</p>

<p>
There are one or two good brasses in the
church, and a small monument to two children
who are traditionally said to have owned Queen
Elizabeth as mother!

<p>
From the reign of Edward VI. to 1780 the
Hoby family held the abbey, and then it was
bought by the ancestors of the present owner. It
is a splendid group of masonry, and stands very
effectively near the river. The tall tower, the oriel
windows, and the red tints against the fine mass of
greenery, make a very unusual picture. Bisham
at one time belonged to the Knights Templars,
who founded here a preceptory. But their Order
was dissolved in the reign of Edward II. In
1338 the Earl of Salisbury established here a
priory for Augustinian monks. This was twice
surrendered, having been re-established after the
first time. It is rather curious that the last prior,
being permitted by the tenets of the Reformed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>
Church to marry, became the father of five
daughters, each of whom married a bishop;
while he himself was Bishop of St. Davids.
Poor Anne of Cleves was presented with the
abbey by her sometime husband the King, who,
however, died before the gift was confirmed.
She was allowed to retain it, and from her it
passed to the Hobys as aforesaid. The house has
therefore a long history, and much of the fabric is
very old. One of the oldest parts is the fine
entrance gateway, dating from the reign of King
Stephen. The great hall is supposed to have been
at one time the church of the abbey. As three
Earls of Salisbury, the great "King Maker"
Warwick, and Edward Plantagenet, unhappy
son of an unhappy father, were all buried in the
abbey church, there is every reason to suppose
that their bones lie beneath the pavement in the
hall.
</p>

<p>
During Queen Mary's reign Princess Elizabeth
was a prisoner at Bisham under the charge of
Sir Thomas Hoby. No doubt she "took water"
frequently, and glided gently down with the stream;
for people were accustomed to use their river when
there were no roads to speak of. She must often
have gazed upon the Quarry Woods in all their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>[114]</a></span>
flaming splendour of autumn, but the Marlow
she knew is so different from our Marlow we can
hardly otherwise picture it. Several alterations
were made at the abbey while Elizabeth was there,
such as the construction of a dais, and a large
window; small points, which show, however, that
she was treated with all due respect. And she
herself has left it on record that she received
kindness and courtesy from her enforced hosts.
These alterations were followed subsequently, in
her own reign, by the rebuilding of much of the
abbey, which was then made as we now see it.

<p>
It is inevitable that such a historic house should
have a tradition or two attached to it; and traditions
are not lacking. It is said that the ghost
of someone drowned in the river rises at times in
the form of a mist, and spreads all across the
channel, and woe be to anyone who attempts to
penetrate it. Another tale is that the house is
haunted by a certain Lady Hoby, who beat her
little boy to death because he could not write
without blots. She goes about wringing her hands
and trying to cleanse them from indelible inkstains.
The story has probably some foundation, for a
number of copybooks of the age of Elizabeth were
discovered behind one of the shutters during some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115'>[115]</a></span>
later alterations, and one of these was deluged in
every line with blots. We all know that great
severity was exercised by parents with their
children at that time; even Lady Jane Grey had
to undergo "pinches, nips, and bobs," until she
thought herself "in hell," while with her parents,
and the story, if not the ghost, may safely be
accepted.
</p>

<p>
Another tradition tells of an elopement. One
of the Earls of Salisbury, about to set out for the
Holy Land, sent for his daughter, who was a nun
at the convent of Little Marlow, to bid him
farewell. She came to him at Bisham, and while
there was persuaded by one of the squires to elope
with him. The pair crossed the water, but were
almost immediately captured. The girl was presumably
returned to her nunnery, where her
escapade would give her something to think of
during all the monotonous days that followed, and
the man was imprisoned at Bisham. In attempting
to make his escape he fell from a high window and
was badly injured. It is said that he afterwards
took the vows and became a monk.
</p>

<p>
Temple Mill and House and Lock, which come
next to Bisham up the river, recall the possession
of the Knights Templars. This and Hurley Lock
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116'>[116]</a></span>
are the two nearest together of all on the river, and
experienced oarsmen frequently catch the second
one by making a dash on high days and holidays
when there is likely to be a crowd and consequent
delay.
</p>

<p>
Interesting as Bisham is, it is rivalled by Hurley,
with its remains of the fine old mansion Lady Place.
</p>

<p>
In order to reach the lock one passes under a
high wooden foot-bridge, "the marrow" to one
further up. On the lock island is a large red-brick
mill-house, near which stand one or two evergreens;
while on an apple tree in the lock-keeper's garden
is a fine growth of mistletoe, of which he is justly
proud. Mistletoe grows a good deal in the valley
of the Thames. It is not as a rule easily seen,
owing to the foliage of the trees on which it
grows; but in the winter, across the frozen
meadows, against the cold white sky, it may be
seen in great tufts that look like giant nests.
</p>

<p>
It is supposed that the seeds of the mistletoe
in order to become fruitful must pass through the
body of the missel thrush, which is extremely
partial to them, and seems to be almost the only
bird that will touch them, hence its name; and
if, as is conjectured, the seeds cannot germinate
without this process, we have the phenomenon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
of an animal forming the "host" for a vegetable
parasite.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the lock there is a sheltered channel
with the quaintest old-world flavour about it, a
flavour which grows yearly more and more difficult
to find as it melts away before the onward sweep
of the advertising age. A strip of green turf is
lined by an old brick wall with lichen and moss
growing on its coping, so that when the sun
catches it, it is like a ribbon of gold. Tall gate
piers, crowned by stone balls, frame a bit of the
excellently kept velvet lawns of Lady Place. There
are many of these old piers and balls, and nearly
all are overgrown with roses.

The splendid cedars, themselves a guarantee of
age that no modern Midas can summon to deck the
grounds of his new mansion; the tinkle of a cowbell
from the meadow near; and the Decorated
windows of Lady Place peering over the wall; all
add to the impression made by the whole. The
abbey was founded in 1086 for Benedictine monks.
It is interesting to note what a very great attraction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>[118]</a></span>
water always held for monks; doubtless the necessity
for Friday fish was one reason for this; but
one likes to think that they also loved the river
for its own sake, and that they found in the
current the same sort of fascination which it
holds for us now. It may be also that it was
the constant gliding of the water, an emblem of
their own smoothly running lives, that drew them
so strongly:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

Of this abbey not much remains. The crypt is
isolated, standing away from the remainder of the
buildings, and anyone may penetrate into it. The
old moat is excellently well preserved, and its circuit
shows that the abbey premises must have
extended over at least five acres of ground. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
church, which is now the parish church, is an odd
little building. It has a single aisle, and the original
work is Norman, though it has been much modernised.
It forms part of a courtyard or quadrangle,
and faces a large, barn-like structure, which was the
refectory; in parts this is also Norman, and in it
are the Decorated windows. The materials used
in the construction of this refectory are most
curious&mdash;brick, chalk, flint, any sort of rubble, all
mixed together, and very solid. The stable is
built in the same way, and it is amazing that such
heterogeneous stuff should have stood the test of
time. Not far off also is a dove-house of a very
ancient pattern. The interior, with its cavernous
gloom and the numerous holes in the chalk for
the birds to nest in, is well worth looking into.
Indeed, the whole of this side of the buildings&mdash;away
from the river&mdash;is worth landing to see. It
is all within a very few yards, and once past the
modern house we find the little church with its
old-fashioned wooden tower, the green with its
well-grown elms, and the dove-house and stable,
which combine to form a very unusual scene
altogether.

<p>
Sir Richard Lovelace, created Baron Lovelace
by Charles I., built Lady Place on the site of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
abbey in 1600. He was a relative of the Cavalier
poet of the same name.
</p>

<p>
In Macaulay's history there is an account of
Lady Place, given graphically as he well knew
how. He is speaking of a descendant of the
founder, and he says:
</p>

<p>
"His mansion, built by his ancestors out of the
spoils of the Spanish galleons from the Indies, rose
on the ruins of a house of Our Lady in that beautiful
valley, through which the Thames, not yet
defiled by the precincts of a great capital, nor
rising and falling with the flow and ebb of the
sea, rolls under woods of beech round the gentle
hills of Berkshire. Beneath the stately saloon,
adorned by Italian pencils, was a subterraneous
vault in which the bones of ancient monks had
sometimes been found."
</p>

<p>
The third Lord Lovelace plotted for the
coming of William of Orange, and in the crypt
many a secret meeting was held to arrange the
details. It is said that the actual invitation which
brought the Dutchman over was signed in this
low, dark vault.
</p>

<p>
Lady Place later belonged to a brother of
Admiral Kempenfelt, who went down with the
<i>Royal George</i>.

Certain places are frequently associated with
certain seasons of the year, and to my mind at
Hurley it is always summer. The smell of the
new mown hay on the long island between the
lock channel and part of the main stream, the
faint, delicate scent of dog-roses, and all the other
scents that load the summer air, seem to linger for
ever in this sheltered place. The backwater running
up on the other side of this island to the
weir is a very enticing one. Thirsty plants dip
their pretty heads to drink of the water that comes
swirling from the weir like frosted glass, and trees
of all sorts&mdash;ash, elm, horse-chestnut, and the
ubiquitous willows and poplars&mdash;lean over the
water in crooked elbows, giving a sweet shade
and a delicious coolness. The weir is a long one,
broken by islands into three parts. Another
long island is parallel to the first one. Indeed,
Hurley is a complicated place, and one that is ever
new. The swans certainly appreciate it. Drayton
says "Our flood's queen, Thames, with ships and
swans is crowned." I don't know about the ships;
nothing very large can get above Molesey Lock;
but as for the swans they abound, and especially
about here.
</p>

<p>
The swans on the river belong to the Crown,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>[122]</a></span>
the Vintners' and the Dyers' Companies. The
grant of this privilege to the companies goes
back so far that it is lost in the mists of antiquity.
The Crown is far the largest holder, but as the
numbers of swans, of course, vary from year to
year, it is difficult to form an estimate of the total.
The Vintners, who come next, own perhaps 150.
They preserve only those that live below Marsh
Lock, with the exception of a few black ones,
which, contrary to expectation, have thriven very
well, and find a happy hunting ground about
Goring and Moulsford. The system of marking,
called swan-upping, has been modified of late years,
as a protest was made against it on the ground of
cruelty. Before that time the Vintners marked
their swans with a large V right across the upper
mandible, but now they give only two little nicks,
one on each side. From this comes the well-known
sign of old yards and public-houses, the Swan with
Two Necks, a corruption of nicks! The Dyers
have a nick on one side only. The origin and
variety of swan marks is a curious subject. The
process of swan-upping, or as it is often incorrectly
called, swan-hopping, gives an occasion for a
pleasant excursion, as it occurs about a fortnight
before the August Bank-Holiday, in the very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
height of the summer. Only the birds of the
current year are done, as the marks generally last
for life, and though they are accustomed to see too
many people to fear mankind, the handling naturally
frightens them. The swans, as a rule, find
their own living, grubbing about in the banks and
on the river bottom, and they are also occasionally
fed from house-boats and pleasure boats, but in
winter sometimes they are hard put to it, and provision
has to be made by their owners.
</p>

<p>
A swan exercises on me something of the same
fascination that a camel does; though far be it
from me to compare the two in grace. They are
both full of character, and both preserve a strictly
critical attitude toward the human race. In the
case of the swan, nature has perhaps dealt unfairly
with him, for the curious little black cap, at the
junction of bill and head, technically known as the
"berry," gives him a fixed expression which he has
no power to alter, even if he felt beaming with
good humour. As it is, he is condemned to go
through life as if he momentarily expected an
attack upon his dignity and was prepared to repel
it. When the sun is shining and the swan dips
his long neck in the water and flings it upon his
shoulders, the large, glistening drops, running
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>[124]</a></span>
together on the oily surface, lie like a necklet of
diamonds in the hollow of his back.
</p>

<p>
The irises and bur-reeds line the low banks
above the weir, and a line of short black poplars
give some shade.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

I have said that Hurley is a summer place,
and so it is; but there is one spring beauty
which those who know it only in summer
must for ever miss. On the slopes where the
heights on the northern side fold into one another
there is a little pillared temple, and about and
around it some lavish and generous person has
planted crocuses in big battalions, and they lie
there in the sun, royal in purple and gold, and
quite as rich in tint as those lights shining through
the stained glass window at Bisham we saw a
while ago.
</p>

<p>
Above the next stretch of the river stands the
great modern palace of Danesfield, which is built
of chalk, one would imagine a singularly unlasting
material. Though hidden by trees from directly
beneath, from a distance it is very noticeable, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125'>[125]</a></span>
the white walls gleam out beneath the red tiles in
a way that cannot be overlooked. It is well thus
to have used local material, for local it is, as can
be seen by the great chalk cliffs that line the river
side; and the idea is daring and original. The
interior fittings are worthy of any palace, and no
pains and cost has been spared. It is a worthy
object to build a house which shall rank with those
bygone mansions on which their owners so lovingly
lavished their thought and time, and which have
also so frequently disappeared. The name arises
from the fact of there having been a Danish camp
in the neighbourhood, and the place is still pointed
out. After this there is rather a flat bit of meadow
land, fringed with sedge and many a gay plant,
growing gallantly in blue and mauve. We pass
two reedy islands opposite a line of little houses
called Frogmill, and then we see Medmenham
Abbey, which looks more imposing than it is,
being at the best a carefully composed ruin. However,
sometimes these compositions, if artistically
done, are worth having, and Medmenham has
memories behind it. It was once a real abbey,
founded for Cistercian monks in 1200. But after
the Dissolution the buildings fell into ruin. Later
they became the headquarters of the daring and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
impious club known as the "Hell Fire" Club, of
which one of the leading spirits was Sir Francis
Dashwood, afterwards Lord Le Despencer, the
same who built the church at West Wycombe,
only a few miles away as the crow flies. This is
a church where the pulpit and reading desk
are armchairs; the latter stands on a chest of
drawers, which, being pulled out, serve as steps.
On the tower of the church an immense ball like
a gigantic football is tethered by chains. This can
contain twelve people, and the mad lord held meetings
here with his friends. The motto of his club
was <i>Fay ce que voudras</i>, and the members went as
near to devil worship as they dared. Once while
they were at Medmenham someone let a huge ape
down the chimney, when the revellers, worked up
to a frantic pitch of excitement and more than half
drunk, thought that his Satanic majesty had paid
them a visit in good earnest. From such orgies
Medmenham has long been free, and it is now a
respectable dwelling house with a nice bit of
cloister over which ivy hangs in folds, and to which
the word "picturesque" may quite fitly be applied.
</p>

<p>
There is a ferry over the river at Medmenham,
and, not far off, the old Abbey Hotel, in which
numbers of artists stay. Up the green lane is a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
curious old house, once the residence of Sir John
Borlase, whom Charles II. used to visit, riding
here on horseback, accompanied frequently, so it is
said, by Nell Gwynne. Standing by the high
road, which here is not half a mile from the river,
is a quaint little church with wooden porch and
shady evergreens, a very model of what a tiny
village church should be.

Human beings
are by nature
sociable; and to
state that a crowd
of well-dressed
people will be at
a certain point
of the river at a
particular date, is
to ensure that
everyone else who
possibly can will
be there too&mdash;only
better dressed. It
would seem to the ordinary ungregarious bachelor
that Boulter's Lock, the Sunday after Ascot, would
be a place to avoid, for there will be the necessity of
waiting for hours on a river&mdash;grilling in the sun if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
the day be fine, or shivering if the day be cloudy;
for the English climate never lacks the spice of
uncertainty, and at this season of the year it is more
capricious than usual. The middle of June is
proverbially a time of roses, but it is just as likely
to be a time for chills, at least so says the
pessimist. To the optimist and he who "loves his
fellow-men," Boulter's Lock, on this one day of the
year, reveals itself to memory as a day of delight
and flashing colour; he has only to shut his eyes
to recall a scene as brilliant as a flower garden.
Here, close to him, lies a long, flat-bottomed punt,
with gay cushions on which lean two fair girls,
their faces toned to a pink glow by the sun's rays
penetrating gently through their rose-pink sunshades.
Their large flapping hats are tied under
their chins with huge bows of ribbon as pink as
their cheeks; their soft, white muslin dresses lie in
folds and frills and heaps bewildering to contemplate;
they are exactly, exasperatingly, absurdly
alike. "How can a woman be such an idiot as
to duplicate her charms?" the onlooker exclaims
to himself; but he looks again. Dark eyes dancing
as merrily as the ripples on the breeze-stirred
water; chatter and laugh; and babble as soft and
meaningless as the gurgle of the little tributary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130'>[130]</a></span>
stream; textures of fabric as delicate as the flowers
peeping over the grey stone walls from the lock-keeper's
garden above; dainty arms bare to the
elbow; Japanese umbrellas jewelled in the sunlight;
striped awnings, as gay as Joseph's coat, flapping
softly; the long low outlines of craft of every kind,
skiff and dingey and canoe, from the smoothly
gliding little electric launch to the heavy clinker-built
boat on hire for its tenth season; these items
make up a scene quite unlike anything else. For
half a mile below the lock you could step across a
solid bridge of boats over half the river. Some
years ago, the homely serge and sailor straw-hat
were considered the proper river costume; now, the
straw is worn only by men, whose severe flannels
show little alteration from year to year, for men
are much more conservative in sartorial matters
than women. And every tantalising muslin, lace,
and flower-decked hat is considered suitable for a
woman on the river. The more fantastic and
enormous, the more gauzy and lace-trimmed, the
better. And, as her grandmother did, the young girl
dresses in the thinnest of muslins and lawns, wears
an open neck in the day time, and elbow sleeves.

In pushing forward between the open lock-gates
into the lock, a slender canoe fits into an almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
impossible space between the electric launch and
the punt. A heavily weighted boatload, where
four elderly women are rowed by one heated man,
falls foul of its neighbour and has to be righted.
The chatter is silenced for a moment, but rises
again when the craft are fitted, like the pieces in
an old fashioned puzzle, inside the green and slimy
walls, which throw a deep shadow on one side.
Then the gates are shut, and a wash and gurgle
of water begins, delightfully cool to hear. A
nervous girl gives a little shriek and jumps so that
every boat is set a-rocking, as all are touching.
Others laugh. It is impossible to upset, for there
is no room. The whole gently swaying mass rises
on the breast of the rising water up out of the
shadow into the sunlight; into the view of the
waiting crowds on the tow-path. Colours flash out
once more; an excited little dog rushes yapping
from stem to stern of his boat, and finally, with a
vigorous jump, lands on the lock-keeper's garden,
where there is a profusion of sweet old-fashioned
flowers, and such roses as grow nowhere but by
the river-side. Then, to the accompaniment of
the dog's frantic barks, the massive gates creak
backward on their hinges, and we ride forward
into the wide expanse of the sparkling river.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
Only a few boats await the opening of the lock
here, for, at this time of day, more are going
up than coming down. But behind, away below
the lock, a chaotic flotilla has once more collected,
and may have to wait for hours, for it is
rather like the process of ladling the river up in a
tablespoon.

This reach at Maidenhead, is one of the most
popular on the river. On each side of the wide
stone bridge half a mile below the lock, Taplow and
Maidenhead face one another. But though popular
and easy of access, being on the Great Western
Railway, which runs quick trains at frequent
intervals, both stations are a little distance from
the river. The name Maidenhead is derived from
Maiden-hithe, or wharf, as a large wharf for wood
at one time stood near the bridge. The bridge
itself, though a modern fabric, is of ancient lineage,
for we know that in 1352 a guild was formed for
the purpose of keeping it in repair. It may be
remembered that bridges at that time were considered
works of charity, and competed with masses
and alms as a means of doing good posthumously.

The main road between London and Bath, a
well-known coaching road, runs this way, and a
very good road it is. The railway bridge crosses
below the road, but it is of brick with wide arches,
and is by no means unsightly. Between the two
is the River-side club, where a band plays on the
smooth green lawn in the season, and the smartest
of smart costumes are the rule. Near here also
is Bond's boat-house and a willow-grown islet.
There are numbers of steps and railings and
landing stages, all painted white, and these give
a certain lightness to the scene. Close by the
bridge are several hotels, of which the oldest
established is Skindle's, low-lying and creeper-covered,
on the Taplow side. Boats for hire line the
banks everywhere, for many cater for the wants of
the butterfly visitor, out of whom enough must
be taken in the season to carry the establishments
on through the winter; and the river visitor is
essentially a butterfly. Few know the charms of
the Thames in the winter, when, in an east and west
stretch, the glowing red ball of the sun sinks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>
behind dun banks of mist; when the trees are
leafless, and the skeleton branches are outlined
against a pale clear sky; when a touch of frost is
in the air, and the river glides so stilly that it
almost seems asleep.

The visitor goes to the river in the summer
because of its coolness, and though the coolness is
ofttimes delusive, being in appearance rather than
reality, lying in the sight of the sparkles and the
sound of the ripples, yet it is a fine make-believe.
Such river-side hotels as cater for the season are
content to lie dormant all the chill long winter,
until, with the breath of early spring, the celandines
raise their polished golden faces and the lords and
ladies stud the hedgerows. Then a few adventurous
beings come down on the first fine days, like the
early swallows, a portent that summer is at hand;
and these lucky people have the river largely to
themselves, and do not find lovers in every
attractive backwater; and if they have to row to
keep themselves warm, they gain an increase of
vigour that no burning summer sun can give.
</p>

<p>
The view from Maidenhead Bridge northwards&mdash;for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>
here the river runs due south&mdash;is spoilt by the
gasometers which rise over the willow-covered
islets. But once past Boulter's Lock, the scenery
improves with every hundred yards. Close by
the lock itself is Ray Mead Hotel, where the
deep carmine-tinted geraniums grow in quantities.
Sometimes as many as three hundred people are
supplied with tea at the hotel on a fine summer
afternoon, while over a thousand pass through the
lock. Above Boulter's is a secluded backwater
formed by the stream of a mill, and this is one of
the pleasantest retreats in the neighbourhood.

Above the river, on the east, rise the cliff-like
heights of Clieveden, wooded to their summits, and
seen magnificently by reason of the curve at the
end of the reach, which gives their full sweep at
one glance. The cliff rises to a height of 140 feet,
but the thickness of the trees, and their own height
towering above, make it look much higher. The
trees are of all kinds, oak and beech, chestnut and
ash, and many a dark evergreen; while here and
there a Lombardy poplar shoots up like a straight
line, and the wild clematis throws its shawls of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>
greenery from tree to tree, giving the whole the
appearance of a tropical forest. Seen in early
spring, when the tender green of the beeches and
the bursting gummy buds of the horse-chestnut are
shedding a veil over the fretwork of twig and
bough, they are glorious enough; but in autumn,
when orange and russet break out in all directions,
they are, perhaps, more imposing. River people
do not, as a rule, see them at their best, for before
that touch of frost has come which sends a flame
of crimson over the maples, and heightens the
orange of the beeches, the fairweather boatsman
has fled to his fireside.
</p>

<p>
At one point we catch a glimpse of Clieveden
itself, standing high and facing downstream. Evelyn
says in his diary:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock, wood,
and prospect, of the Duke of Buckingham's, buildings of
extraordinary expense.... The stande, somewhat like
Frascati as to its front, and on the platform is a circular
view to the utmost verge of the horizon, which, with the
serpenting of the Thames, is admirable.... But the
land all about wretchedly barren, and producing nothing
but fern.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The taste of those days differed from ours; now
we should prefer to see an expanse of ferns to a
field of potatoes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The first great mansion here was built by
"Steenie," the Duke of Buckingham, King Charles's
favourite. He was a villain, even for a time of
slack morals, and the chief association connected
with his house is that he brought here a comrade
in every way suited to him, in the person of the
Countess of Shrewsbury, who stood by, dressed as
a page, holding his horse, while he killed her
husband in a duel. The house was twice burnt
down; the present one was built about the middle
of the nineteenth century, and belongs to Mr.
Astor. A pleasanter memory is that of the poet
Thomson, whose masque <i>Alfred</i> was acted here in
1740, on the birthday of Princess Augusta. This
contained, as a kernel, the song "Rule Britannia,"
destined to survive long after its husk had been
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Opposite Clieveden the ground is low lying,
and, to use Evelyn's word, the river "serpents" a
good deal. There are several islands, on one of
which, called Formosa, there is a house. There
are several side-streams crossed by footbridges,
and in one of these is the lock. The main stream
continues in a great sweep, and is guarded by two
weirs. The fishing here is very popular, and though
it belongs to Lord Boston, permission to fish may
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
be obtained by writing beforehand. Hedsor Church
stands well on high ground near; and with its
bosky foliage and many islets, the river here is not
a bad place in which to idle away many an hour.
</p>

<p>
The hotel at Cookham is right down on the
water's edge, and from its lawn a charming view is
gained of the main stream breaking into its many
channels, with the wooded island of Formosa in
the middle. All about here is a favourite place
for anglers, and many a punt is moored across
stream with its ridiculous chairs on which sit two
or three solemn elderly men, content to sit, and
sit, and watch the dull brown water rush beneath
for hour after hour, without once raising their eyes
to see the green of the witching trees, or listening
to the hum of the joyous life around them. To an
onlooker they appear to be quaffing the flattest
part of the sport, having missed all its head and
froth. How different the punt fisher's day from
that of the man who starts off up-stream, through
many a low-lying willow-fringed meadow, who
reaches over to land his fly in the deep brown pool
into which the stream falls. Punt fishing, like loch
fishing, must have its fascinations, or few would do
it, but it lacks all the sparkle expressed in such a
song as that of Walton's, for instance:

<p>

</p>

<p>
From Cookham Bridge we can see the gaily
covered lawn of the hotel, where a perfect flotilla
of craft is anchored, while the owners have tea or
more cooling drinks; and turning we can view the
wide expanse of Bourne End, where the races of
the Upper Thames Sailing Club are held all the
summer, and where, about the end of June, when
the great regatta is held, the surface of the water
is dotted with swan-like boats.

CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
WINDSOR AND ETON
</span></h2>

<p>
However disappointed a foreign monarch, on his
first visit to England, may be with the drab
hideousness of Buckingham Palace, he cannot
but confess that in Windsor Castle we have a
dwelling meet even for the King of England.
Both architecturally and by reason of its age,
Windsor is a truly royal palace. Its history is
linked with that of our kings until its very
stones proclaim the annals of our country. Ages
ago, Edward the Confessor took a fancy to this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
quiet place by the Thames, and he gave it to
his beloved monks of Westminster. William I.
saw what a splendid shooting lodge might be
built in the midst of the wild and open country
abounding in game, and after having first one
shooting lodge and then another in the neighbourhood,
he acquired the high outstanding boss or
knob of chalk on which the castle stands, and
built thereon a residence for himself. His son,
Henry I., altered it greatly; and succeeding kings
and queens have rarely been content to leave it
without an alteration or addition as their mark.
Windsor has ever been a favourite with royalty.
It has held its own while Westminster and Whitehall
and Greenwich utterly vanished; while the
Tower and Hampton have ceased to be royal
dwellings; and it is still pre-eminently the royal
castle. Certain kings, such as William III., have
sometimes preferred other places for a while,
but Windsor has satisfied alike the dignity of
Edward III. and the homeliness of George III.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i309" id="i309"></a>
<img src="images/i-309.jpg" width="550" height="439" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WINDSOR CASTLE
</p>
</div>

<p>
The situation is superb. The castle stands high
above the river, which here curves, so as to show
off its irregular outlines to the greatest advantage.
They rise in a series of rough levels to the
mighty Round Tower, the crown of the whole,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
which is massive enough to dominate, but not
sufficiently high to dwarf the rest. Turrets, battlements,
and smaller towers serve only to emphasize
the dignity of this central keep. It was built in
the time of Edward III., and strangely enough,
though altered and heightened in that worst period
of architectural taste, the reign of George IV.,
it was not spoiled; and even to a child proclaims
something of the grandeur one naturally associates
with it.
</p>

<p>
As seen from the bridge the whole of the north
range can be followed by the eye, from the Prince
of Wales's Tower, facing the east terrace, to the
Curfew Tower on the west. Intermediately there
are the State apartments, and the Norman gateway,
over which is the Library. These overlook the
north terrace&mdash;open to the public at all hours
from sunrise to sunset.
</p>

<p>
The view from this terrace is very fine, stretching
away to Maidenhead, and at times, on days of
cloud and shadow, the light-coloured walls of
Clieveden stand out suddenly, caught by a passing
gleam, amid a forest of green trees. We can
look down on the whole of Eton&mdash;the church
with its tall spire; the buttresses and pinnacles of
the chapel standing up white against an indigo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>
background; the red and blue roofs piled this way
and that; and the green playing fields girdled by
the swift river. It was on the castle terrace that
George III. used to walk with all his family,
except the erring eldest, when he took those tiresome
parades which Miss Burney describes with
so much life-like detail.
</p>

<p>
The Chapel cannot be seen from the river, as
it is in the lower ward behind the canons' houses,
and is not sufficiently high to rise well above them.
</p>

<p>
It would be of little use to attempt to tell
stories of Windsor, for its history belongs to the
history of England and not to the river Thames;
yet there is one memory which may be noted.
Young James Stuart of Scotland had been sent
by his father, Robert III., to France after the
death of his elder brother, the wild Duke of
Rothesay, nominally for education, but in reality
for safe keeping. The boy was captured by
the English while on the sea and brought as
a prisoner to England. He was then only about
ten or twelve years old. He was treated with
every consideration, and educated so worthily
that he became afterwards one of the best of
all the Scottish kings. He was at first in the
Tower and elsewhere, but when he reached young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>
manhood he was brought to Windsor, where he
had apartments allotted to him. Though he was
allowed to follow the chase and pursue the amusements
of his time, he was yet a prisoner, and
the sad opening stanzas of his great poem, the
<i>Kingis Quair</i>, speak the melancholy he often
felt. This poem was composed at Windsor, and
its pensiveness changes after the day when, looking
down from his window in the castle, the
youth saw walking in the garden Joan Beaufort,
whom he afterwards made his wife:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
And therewith cast I down mine eye again,
</p>
<p>
Where as I saw, walking under the tower,
</p>
<p>
The fairest or the freshest young flower
</p>
<p>
That ever I saw methought before that hour.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
His visions further on in the poem must have
been coloured more or less by what he daily saw
before him, and we may credit to the Thames the
flowing lines:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Where in a lusty plain took I my way,
</p>
<p>
Along a river pleasant to behold,
</p>
<p>
Embroidered all with fresh flowers gay,
</p>
<p>
Where, through the gravel, bright as any gold,
</p>
<p>
The crystal water ran so clear and cold.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i317" id="i317"></a>
<img src="images/i-317.jpg" width="433" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WINDSOR
</p>
</div>

<p>
Windsor should be seen in sunshine and heat,
when black shadows set off the towering walls,
and all the uneven houses and crooked streets
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145'>[145]</a></span>
are pieced in light and shade. Then it is exceedingly
like a foreign town in its details; and many
people who travel miles to admire Chinon, and
others of its class, would do well to visit Windsor
first.
</p>

<p>
The town has always been subordinate to the
castle, for it was the castle that caused the town
to spring up, as there were always numbers of
artificers, attendants, grooms, workmen and others
needed for the service of the Court. In the
fourteenth century it was reckoned that the
Court employed an army of 20,000 of such people.
These would all have to be housed somehow,
and the nearer the protection of the castle the
better; hence the town on the slopes.
</p>

<p>
The Home Park, in which is the mausoleum,
borders the river. It is separated by a road from
the Great Park, made for hunting. Pope's poem
on "Windsor Forest" is not particularly beautiful;
perhaps the best descriptive lines are those that
follow:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
There, interspersed in lawns and opening glades,
</p>
<p>
Thin trees arise that shun each others shades:
</p>
<p>
Here in full light the russet plains extend;
</p>
<p>
There, wrapt in clouds, the bluish hills ascend.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Windsor Park is introduced by Shakspeare as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>
the scene of some of Falstaff's escapades, an
honour shared by the neat, bright village of
Datchet, opposite. Datchet is a model village
grouped about a green, and the houses are softened
by all the usual creepers and bushes: we see
roses, jasmine, laurustinus, magnolia, and ampelopsis
at every turn. Above and below Datchet
this clean neatness continues.
</p>

<p>
The Victoria and Albert bridges are severe,
and the weir and the great bow of the channel,
which is cut by the lock-stream, have no particular
characteristics. The whole neighbourhood has
rather the air of holding itself on its best behaviour,
as though royalty might any moment appear
upon the scene. As might be expected, the
scenery is rather like the poetry it inspired. Here
is Sir John Denham's effusion about Coopers
Hill:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
My eye, descending from the hill, surveys
</p>
<p>
Where Thames, among the wanton valleys strays:
</p>
<p>
Thames, the most loved of all the Ocean's sons
</p>
<p>
By his old sire, to his embraces runs:
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Hasting to pay his tribute to the sea,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Like mortal life to meet eternity.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
There is a pretty reach below Old Windsor,
where willows and poplars are massed effectively.
It is in places like this, where they grow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>[147]</a></span>
abundantly, that the beautiful tawny colour
which willows assume in the spring, just before
bursting into leaf, can be best seen.
</p>

<p>
The Bells of Ouseley stands at a bend, and with
its tinted walls and the old elm tree growing close
to the entrance, is a typical old-English Inn. The
road to Staines passes by the water's edge, and the
guide-post is less reticent than guide-posts are
wont to be, for it tells us this is the "Way to
Staines, except at high-water."
</p>

<p>
As we pass softly back up the current to Eton,
we think how often in this reach the incomparable
Izaak and his friend Sir Henry Wotton fished
together.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I sat down under a willow tree by the water side ...
for I could there sit quietly, and, looking on the water, see
some fishes sport themselves in the silver streams, others
leaping at flies of several shapes and colours; ...
looking down the meadows, could see here a boy gathering
lilies and ladysmocks, and there a girl cropping culverkeys
and cowslips.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Wotton built a fishing box a mile below the
college, from which he and Walton often sallied
forth during the fifteen years he was provost of
Eton, and to his rod many a "jealous trout that
low did lie, rose at a well dissembled fly," as he
himself has left on record.

In rounding the great sweep of the river below
the London and South Western railway bridge,
we catch at once the pinnacles of Eton chapel&mdash;most
glorious of chapels&mdash;and see the green playing
fields.
</p>

<p>
The long tree-covered island of Romney, on
one side of which lies the lock, ends in a terrible
"snout," strengthened by "camp-shedding." This
point is locally known as the "Cobbler," and is a
source of peril to many an inexperienced boatman.

<p class="caption">ETON CHAPEL FROM THE FIELDS
</p>
</div>

<p>
The bridge over the river can, unfortunately,
hardly be called a good feature in the landscape&mdash;it
is as ugly as a railway bridge! Just above it
is a row of boat-houses, and then follows the
Brocas, the famous meadow. Above the bridge
is a tiny islet which serves as an objective in the
Fourth of June procession of boats. The boats
come down and round the island, and once more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149'>[149]</a></span>
returning, pass under the bridge to the lock,
having made a sort of spiral. Nearly all the
Eton races are rowed in this strip of the river,
though, of course, Henley Regatta is the greatest
event in the boating calendar. A small string of
islands faces some little public gardens, and away
northward winds the Great Western Railway
on a series of small arches which carry it over
the marshy ground, no doubt at one time under
water.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the line is a small backwater known as
Cuckoo weir, the bathing place of the lower boys.
Here the swimming trials take place, when a set
of trembling pink youngsters stand in a punt
ready to take a graceful header, or, from sheer
nervousness, to fall with an ugly flop smack upon
the water and be disqualified for the time being!
</p>

<p>
The bathing place of the upper boys, called
by the dignified title of Athens, is further up in
the main river, near the curious island on which
is Windsor racecourse. The river winds giddily
in and out between the end of this island and
Upper and Lower Hope, which lie between it
and Cuckoo weir. A mill stands at the end of the
long narrow stream that separates the racecourse
from the mainland, and on the other side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'>[150]</a></span>
island is Boveney Lock. The quaint old chapel
stands amid trees further up.
</p>

<p>
Above the island was once Surley Hall, a
favourite resort of the Etonians, but it is now
pulled down, and Monkey Island is the place to
go to on half-holidays. Monkey Island is a good
way up, and is the third of a row of islands. The
little one below it, called Queen's ait, now belongs
to the Eton boys, who have built a small cottage
on it. Monkey Island itself is a curious and
attractive place, except when the launches come
up from Windsor on Saturdays, bringing hundreds
of people, who sit about at little tables on the
green sward under the famous walnut trees, and
call for refreshments. There is a large pavilion,
part boat-house, which belongs to the Eton boys,
where they can get tea served without mingling
with the townspeople. Near it is a quaint little
temple. This, as well as the house, now the hotel,
was built by the third Duke of Marlborough, a
man of curious taste. The hall in the hotel is
painted all round with the figures of monkeys
engaged in various sports and pastimes. There is
a broad frieze which appears to have been executed
in water colours on plaster; the ceiling is likewise
painted, but in rather a different style. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151'>[151]</a></span>
monkeys are a good size, and attract a vast crowd
of visitors. The pretty verandah round the hotel
redeems its appearance externally. Inside it has
at once all the attractions and disadvantages of
an old house&mdash;low ceilings, very small rooms; but
on the other hand there are windings and twistings,
crooked passages and odd corners, that delight
the heart of those to whom machine-made houses
are an abomination. The duke's bedroom is shown,
and is as queerly shaped a room as ever mortal
man conceived. Monkey Island is being embanked
with the precious gravel dredged from
the bed of the Thames, and, though no doubt
a necessary precaution, as the river insidiously
breaks off what it can, the operation is not a
beautiful one. The island is very proud of its
walnut trees, and well it may be, for they are
a great change after the ubiquitous willows, and
their gnarled stems and fine shady leaves are just
the right element in such a scene as a gay lawn
covered with summer folk in summer dresses.
</p>

<p>
From Monkey Island the little church tower
of Bray can be seen, but before reaching it Bray
Lock has to be negotiated, and here are a long
sinuous osier-covered ait and a mill, making, as
usual, a convenient backwater.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>[152]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Bray is truly a charming place, and one could
find it in one's heart to forgive the vicar who
turned his coat to keep his vicarage. The real
man lived in the reign of Henry VIII. and
his successors, and changed his religious practices
in conformity with those of the sovereign for
the time being, turning from Roman Catholic to
Reformed Church, Reformed to Roman Catholic,
and back once more with ease and pliability. In
the ballad he is represented as living in the seventeenth
century, and his gymnastics refer to the
varying fortunes of the house of Stuart, and the
Romish tendencies of the later kings of that
house. Fuller, with his usual quaintness, remarks
of him that he had seen some martyrs burnt
at Windsor and "found this fire too hot for
his tender temper." But one would fain believe
it was not altogether cowardice, but also a love
of his delightful village, that made him so amenable.
The little flint and stone tower of the
church peeps at the river over a splendid assortment
of evergreens&mdash;laurels, holm oaks, yews,
and spruce firs being particularly noticeable&mdash;and
the old vicarage with this growth of sheltering
trees and its smooth lawn right down to the
water's edge, is certainly a place that one would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>[153]</a></span>
think twice about before leaving. The village
itself is so irregular that, tiny as it is, one may
get lost in it. There are endless vistas of gable
ends, of bowed timbers, of pretty porches, and
worn brick softly embraced by vine or wistaria;
yet even in Bray, new red brick is making its
way. One of the most interesting features is the
almshouses, and if one lands by the hotel, they
are reached after only a few minutes' walk. The
exterior is very quaint; large cylindrical yews and
hollies, like roly-poly puddings on end, stand up in
stubborn rank before the worn red brick. The
statue of the founder, of an immaculate whiteness,
with the glitter of gilt in the coat-of-arms below,
just lightens the effect. Through an ancient arch
one passes to the quadrangle, which is filled with
tiny flower-beds, and surrounded by a low range
of red brick with dormer windows. At the
other side is the chapel covered with ivy, and this,
with the little diamond panes and the brightness
of the variegated flower-beds, is home-like and cosy.
Yet it must be confessed that in his well-known
picture, "The Harbour of Refuge," admittedly
taken from Bray, Frederick Walker, the artist, has
greatly improved the scene with artistic licence.
The raised terrace at the side, the greater width
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154'>[154]</a></span>
of the quadrangle, the smooth green lawn and
sheltering central tree in his picture, are far more
harmonious and beautiful than the reality.
</p>

<p>
Bray is a very popular haunt with artists and
boating people. In summer the George Hotel
cannot take in all its visitors, and beds are hired
all over the village, consequently, anyone wishing
to spend some weeks in Bray must make arrangements
well beforehand. This is not to be
wondered at, because, as well as its own attractions,
it is within easy reach of Maidenhead and the
delights beyond, and its unspoilt quaintness makes
it ideal to stay in. Long may Bray remain as
it is, unaltered and a tiny village.

MAGNA CHARTA

<p>
Magna Charta
Island is something
of a shock
at first sight; it
is so exceptionally
well cared for and
so pretty. One
pictures a tangle
of wild trees, a
mass of rushes,
osiers perhaps, and
general grimness.
The osiers are
confined to a fraction
of the island; on the remainder is a prettily-built
house of a fair size, with the very best sort of
river-lawn, on which grow various fine and regular
trees. Many are the evergreens; and the bosky
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
holm oak, the dignified stone pine, and the
flourishing walnut, seen in conjunction with the
beautifully kept turf and bright flower-beds, are
altogether unlike one's conception of the place.
</p>

<p>
It is true that, though the island has the name
of it, it is now generally supposed that the actual
signing of our great charter of liberties took place
on the mainland. John had delayed, and played
false, and postponed the issue for long, but he
knew now that all was up, and he was cornered.
A truce was declared, and from Windsor he agreed
to meet his barons and "concede to them the laws
and liberties which they asked." The fifteenth of
June was fixed for the day, and Runney Mead, or
Runnymede, for the place. With the barons were
almost the whole of the English nobility; with
John, certain ecclesiastical powers, namely, the
Archbishops of Canterbury and Dublin, and seven
bishops, as well as some earls and barons. It is
quite obvious that the barons could have had no
idea of the vast consequences of their act. They
would have been astonished could they have foreseen
that it would become the basis of the English
constitution. They merely wanted to bind down
a particular king who had outraged their liberties.
</p>

<p>
One can hardly imagine a better place for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
assembling of a great body of armed men than
these meadows by the river. The land is as flat
as a platform, and sheltered to the south by the
heights of Cooper's Hill, which rise like the tiers
in an amphitheatre. The Long Mead, with the
exception of the road now running across it, must
have looked very much then as it does now. Runney
Mead is more altered, because it is shut in by hedges.
We know not if the day were fine or overcast when
the great charter was signed; but when the deed was
done John, in a rage, retired to Windsor. The
barons remained on the meads for about ten days,
during which the place must have been like a fair.
</p>

<p>
It is very hot on this part of the river on a
sunny day. The trees growing on the banks are
all on the north side, and consequently give little
shade. They border Ankerwyke Park, and grow
so close to the water that many of their roots are
in it. The swallows dart to and fro, and clouds of
gnats dance like thistledown in the air. Near the
banks grow many flowers. The spotted knotweed
or persicaria, with its bright flesh-coloured flowers,
is sometimes in water, sometimes on the land;
the common forget-me-not can be seen peeping
up with its bright blue eyes; the pink willow herb
flourishes; and the yellow iris and the purple
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158'>[158]</a></span>
loosestrife are also to be seen. And when there
is no wind the scent of the meadow-sweet and
the dog-roses becomes almost overpowering.
</p>

<p>
Ankerwyke was once a priory. It was appropriated
by Henry VIII., who is said to have carried
on the courtship of Anne Boleyn under the mighty
chestnuts for which it was even then famous:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
A bit of doggerel just about worthy of the
occasion!
</p>

<p>
A more interesting association, though one that
leads us rather far from the river, is Milton's residence
at Horton. He lived here with his parents
for five years after leaving Cambridge, and no
doubt his rambles over country which would not
then be hedged in and cut up as it is now, often
led him in the direction of the river. It was
this scenery, noted at those deeply impressionable
years, that he could still see when earthly sight
was gone.

Not very far below Ankerwyke, the river Coln
runs into the Thames near Bell Weir Lock, and
a little bit above Staines is London Stone, standing
in a meadow close by the water. It marked the
former jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor of London
over the river, but these rights are now vested
in the Thames Conservators. Staines does not
make the most of itself, or sufficiently endeavour to
veil those unsightlinesses incidental to a town.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>[160]</a></span>
The large gasometers opposite London Stone are
not the only blemishes. Standing on the bridge
and looking up-stream there are many ugly,
yellow-brick, manufacturing buildings to be seen;
while the screen of willows does not hide piles
of untidy stones, rusty old iron and other uglinesses.
Even the very passable island in the centre
does not atone. Down stream things are a little
better, though the want of architectural beauty in
the new church by the river and the "plastered-on"
pinnacles of the parish church are both eyesores.
</p>

<p>
From Staines, however, one may pass rapidly to
a fascinating corner at Penton Hook.

<img src="images/i-339.jpg" width="321" height="408" alt="" />

<p>
Penton Hook
is quite peculiar.
To a select little
coterie of people
it is <i>the</i> place on
the river, but
to hundreds of
others it is not
known at all. To
its own manifest
advantage it is off
the "hard high
road," and the
scorchers and the
bounders, and the multitude generally, fly by within
a comparatively short distance, little knowing what
they have missed. But one or two of the favoured
few turn down to quiet little Laleham, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>[162]</a></span>
wheeling round a corner come right on to the
tow-path by the river's brink; in a hundred yards
they are at Penton Hook. But though the Hook
is very select and highly favoured, that is not to
say it lacks population, only&mdash;it is a population
of the right sort. Little camps of charming
bungalows dot the banks both above and below
the lock. Some are built on ground leased from
the Conservancy, some on that of private owners.
To each man is allotted a strip of ground, with
so much river frontage, whereon he builds to his
own taste and fancy a little one-storeyed white-painted
house, and lays out the tiny garden from
which his own white steps reach down to the
water. Think of the joy of it! The leader in
an important case has been in a stuffy court
all day, burdened with his wig and gown, seeing
all the dust and stains of unswept corners of
human nature; accusing, with upraised finger, the
brazen witness who has just perjured himself;
dragging from that yellow-faced man the secret
he thought buried. Faugh! But the court rises;
he is away. The motor takes him down in less
than an hour. Gone are the stifling garments;
the worn and wicked faces. The dull roar of
Strand traffic is replaced by the splashing of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'>[163]</a></span>
water as it bounds over the weir. The freed
man tumbles into flannels and lies full length
on the green grass, smoking, with the water
flowing at his feet, or he dawdles in a boat
round the Hook, tempting the fish with all the
decoys he knows. Happy man!
</p>

<p>
The trees near the bungalows, and those that
fringe the meadows near, are not pollarded; there
is space between their tall stems. The short grass,
gemmed with pink-tipped daisies, can be seen
everywhere, and there is air, and freshness, and
openness for everyone. The white paint of the
bungalows and their neat green or pink roofs,
the rows of geraniums, roses, and other flowers
carefully kept and tended, add touches of gaiety
and brightness.
</p>

<p>
There are three weirs, for the river here makes
the neatest horse-shoe in its whole length, and
the authorities have cut through the neck of land,
so that the greater part of the stream goes rioting
and tumbling in joyous confusion beneath the great
new weir, provided with a pent-house roof, under
which it is always cool on the hottest summer day,
with transparent reflections dancing on the wall
and a ripple and splash below. The second
weir, a mere tumbling-weir, is only a few yards
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164'>[164]</a></span>
away. The water does not often leap over it
unless it is at flood time, when it affords a safety
outlet. The third and widest is a mixture, half
sluice gates and half of the tumbling kind. At
one time there was no weir here, and boats could
avoid the lock by navigating the Hook, but
that is now no longer possible. There is one
advantage in it; it keeps the Hook more secluded.
The little red water-gauge house is connected
by wires with Staines, and so to all the rest
of England. By an automatic arrangement, the
register shows simultaneously here and at the
offices of the water company what depth of water
there is, so that they may know how much they
can take.
</p>

<p>
At Penton it should be always summer, with
dog-roses and sweetbriar, with placid red cows
grazing on the tender grass, with boats tethered
in the lazy current round the bend of the Hook.
</p>

<p>
An uncommonly good place for fishing it is,
this Hook, as the kingfishers have found out, for
they are yearly increasing, and apparently do not
mind the gay tide of summer company that
invades their haunts. Right down on the banks
near the lock one pair nested this year. No
steamers churn up the waters and frighten the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165'>[165]</a></span>
fish; only a slow-moving house-boat or two towed
to position and there left, or those drifting boats
belonging to young men and maidens who are
content to drift metaphorically as well as actually.
</p>

<p>
The Abbey river starts away on its own account
on the far side of the Hook, and begins its short
course of about a couple of miles, to fall into the
Thames again at Chertsey. It used to be possible
to get up it in a boat, but now it is barred.
However, visitors have nothing to complain of,
for the meadows around are singularly open to
them, and the place is not hedged about with
restrictions as are so many river resorts. Numbers
of people come down to picnic, and it is no
uncommon sight to see quite a row of motors
outside the lock-keeper's house, while footman
or chauffeur carries across the luncheon hampers
to what was once a peninsula but is now an
island. Tradesmen's carts come round too, finding
in the swallow-colony quite enough demand
to make it worth their while; and year by year
the bungalows grow. A whole new piece of
meadow, hitherto osier bed, is even now going
to be devoted to them. "Why, I get as many as
twenty to thirty applications for land every week,"
says the lock-keeper. It is to be hoped Penton
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>[166]</a></span>
Hook will not become over-populated, or the
delightful freedom from conventionality which
now characterises it might die away. "Ladies
who come down here&mdash;why, some of them, they
never put a hat on their heads the whole time,
and I was going to say not shoes or stockings
either!" The place is particularly sought after by
theatrical people. Miss Ellen Terry still holds
the bungalow she has had for many years.
It is surprising how early the season begins; even
at the end of chilly March a few of the first of
the swallows appear.

<p>
Between Chertsey
and Penton
Hook is Laleham,
where the tiny ivy-covered
church is
too much hidden
away to be seen
easily. An old
red brick moss-grown
wall is the
chief object near
the river, and
with the bending
trees and quiet
fields there is a sense of brooding peace which only
remains in places off the main roads. Matthew
Arnold was born at Laleham and is buried in the
churchyard. His father, Dr. Arnold of Rugby,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>[168]</a></span>
came here in 1819, but he left when Matthew was
only six, to take the head-mastership of Rugby.
</p>

<p>
Between Laleham and Chertsey there is some
open, rather untidy ground on which gypsies
are wont to camp. It cannot be said that the
river looks its best above Chertsey. The country
is too flat and open, and on a summer day one
is too often scorched. Yet there is always some
beauty to be found, and it is certainly in open
spaces like these that we see best reflected
"heaven's own blue." Away to the west the
tiny Abbey river flows in past a mill. By
Chertsey bridge a triumphant victory in regard
to right-of-way over the Thames Conservancy in
1902, is recorded on two newly built villas.
Opposite is the Bridge Hotel, which, with its
little bay, its Lombardy poplars and green lawn, is
a pleasant oasis.
</p>

<p>
Chertsey Abbey, which was of great fame, lay
between the town and the river. It was founded
in 666, and some Saxon tiles from the flooring
may be seen in the British Museum. The
buildings were destroyed by the Danes, but
it was re-established in 964 as a Benedictine
Monastery.
</p>

<p>
Nothing shows more the immense power of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169'>[169]</a></span>
monks in England than these mighty abbeys
which studded the country. We have come
across so many, even in our short journey between
Oxford and London, that the fact cannot escape
notice; though they probably were more thickly
set beside the river than elsewhere, because, as
I have said, flowing water attracted these old
monks for more than one reason. There is hardly
anything left of Chertsey Abbey now, yet in its
prime it was like a small town, giving employment
to hundreds of people. There are a few ivy-covered
steps near the back of the church and an
old bit of wall doubtfully supposed to have been
part of the boundary; this is near the Abbey
river. Henry VI. was buried at Chertsey, and
his funeral is referred to in Shakespeare's play of
<i>Richard III.</i>:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
... after I have solemnly interr'd
</p>
<p>
At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king,
</p>
<p>
And wet his grave with my repentant tears.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
So he makes the hypocritical Duke of Gloucester
speak. Cowley, the poet, lived in Chertsey for
two years before his death. The house still stands;
it has an overhanging storey and is covered with
rough stucco. Charles James Fox was born in
a house near, and this probably decided him in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170'>[170]</a></span>
making choice of a residence many years later,
for he chose St. Anne's Hill, only two miles away,
which can be seen far and wide around. There
he settled to indulge in the delightful hobby of
improving his grounds.
</p>

<p>
Below Chertsey Bridge is an excellent punting
reach, where the championship punting competition
is held every year in the beginning of
August. This is, doubtless, the reason why
Chertsey is crowded with visitors in the summer,
when out of all the innumerable lodgings scarcely
a room is to be had.
</p>

<p>
The river about Weybridge and Shepperton is
much more varied than at Chertsey, and to my
mind variety is a direct element of beauty in
river scenery. We have passed through flat
meadows lined with straight ranks of Lombardy
poplars that might belong to northern France,
and then suddenly, at Weybridge, we begin
once more curves and twists and unexpected
islands and snug corners. There is a ferry across
the river, and the place seems to get along
wonderfully well without a bridge. In the
middle of the stream is a well-kept island which
belonged to the late Mr. D'Oyly Carte; it is
hedged about with an exclusive wall, enclosing a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>[171]</a></span>
pretty garden. In the centre is a neat white
house with projecting tiles.
</p>

<p>
In every direction there are numerous boat-building
establishments. The lock island is large
and has other buildings on it besides the lock-keeper's
cottage. It is a favourite camping ground
in summer, and has rather an untidy appearance.
The wide-mouthed Wey flows in beside a
couple of other islands, and is itself a very
attractive place to explore, winding away through
meadows and beneath overhanging trees. It is,
however, not free from locks, though of a somewhat
simpler kind than those on the Thames.
Weybridge is a fresh and pleasant place, rapidly
growing in all directions, and in its gorsy common
land and masses of pine woods it reminds
one of the parts of Surrey about Camberley. On
the green stands the column which once presented
seven faces to the seven streets in London, called
after it Seven Dials. Since then it has risen
in life, having been bought and surmounted with
a coronet instead of the dial stone; this was in
honour of the Duchess of York, who died in 1820.
She lived at Oatlands Park and was very popular.
</p>

<p>
Oatlands Park is the great place of the neighbourhood.
It was once a hunting ground of King
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172'>[172]</a></span>
Henry VIII., but now belongs to a large residential
hotel. Nothing remains of the building,
which was used by many of our English monarchs.
George IV. entertained here the Emperor of
Russia, the King of Prussia, and all the princes
and generals who visited England after Waterloo.
In 1790 the Duke of York, who is commemorated
by the column in Waterloo Place, bought and
rebuilt the house, and still later it was in the
possession of the Earl of Ellesmere. Remodelled,
the house still stands as the hotel. A large piece
of ornamental water in the grounds is almost
as great an attraction as Virginia Water. Just
where the park touches the river is the place
known as Cowey Stakes. It is said that here
Cæsar crossed the river when in pursuit of
Cassivelaunus, in 54 <span class='s08'>B.C.</span> The stakes, which are
no longer to be seen, are supposed to have been
placed there to obstruct his use of the ford.
They had been so long under water, that when
found they were like ebony; they were about
six feet long and shod with iron. They appear
to have been too imposing and carefully formed
to have been put in for the mere purpose of a
river weir or for fishing; but, on the other hand,
instead of running with the axis of the river,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173'>[173]</a></span>
as would appear reasonable if they were meant
to obstruct the passage of men, they were planted
across it like a weir. They have afforded matter
for endless discussion among antiquaries.

<p class="caption">WALTON BRIDGE
</p>
</div>

<p>
What we know is that Cæsar, having landed
at Pevensey, marched inland and came to the
Thames at about eighty miles from the sea. The
river was fordable only at one place, and here
natives were drawn up to oppose him, and the ford
fortified with sharp stakes. So the evidence
certainly seems in favour of this place.
</p>

<p>
Near Cowey Stakes is Walton Bridge, on the
far side of which is a large pool connected with
the river by a channel; here are constantly to
be found punt fishers. Turner painted Walton
Bridge, and certainly, in some aspects, the place
is worthy of being painted. The present bridge
is of brick and iron, but the old one was of oak.
Walton, like every other place on the Thames,
depends greatly on the weather. On days when
the cedars are seen against a vivid blue sky and
the songs of a thousand birds are heard, when
the meadows are lined with flowers, it is beautiful.
</p>

There are other days when the whole is
curiously like a platinotype photograph; when the
steel-grey water reflects a white sun, and all the
countless twigs of the trees are seen in one
feathery mass. All colours seem drawn out of
the picture, even the green of the grass is turned
to dun. Light is everything in estimating beauty,
but it is sometimes difficult to realise quite how
much one owes to it. We might quote from
Cowley's <i>Hymn to the Light</i>:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Thou in the moon's bright chariot proud and gay

<p>
In Walton Church is a small brass with, <i>inter
alia</i>, a man riding on a stag's back. The story
goes that this man, John Selwyn, was an under-keeper
in Oatlands Park in Queen Elizabeth's
time, and that when she was present at the
"chace," he leapt from his own horse's back
straight on to that of the driven stag, when "he
not only kept his seat gracefully in spite of every
effort of the affrighted beast, but, drawing his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175'>[175]</a></span>
sword, with it guided him toward the Queen,
and coming near her presence plunged it into
his throat, so that the animal fell dead at her
feet."

Admiral Rodney was a native of Walton, and an

<p>
Below Walton is Sunbury with its long, long
weirs, and its little houses spread beside the edge
of the water. But with Hampton we reach
the Londoner's zone, which is for another chapter.
At present Halliford and Shepperton, two little
places opposite Oatlands, are far too pretty to
be passed by without remark. The Manor House
at Shepperton has one of the finest lawns on the
river, which is no small thing. Shepperton is a
scattered place and lies low; the meadows all
around are often flooded for miles and miles,
looking like an inland sea. A tiny river called
the Exe finds its way into the Thames near
Halliford. A glimpse of the quaint church of
Shepperton should not be missed. The tower
is very lean and narrow; it looks rather as if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176'>[176]</a></span>
bricks had run short. It was added later than
the rest, which was built in 1614. Tradition says
that the previous church was destroyed by a
Thames flood, though it stood on piles to raise it
from the marshy ground. The old rectory, with
its dormer windows and projecting wings, is really
built of oak, though it has been faced with tiles
which look like brick. It is about four hundred
years old, and is one of the most delightful rectory
houses imaginable. The list of rectors goes back
to before 1330.

As far as Hampton
the river may
be said to lie
within the zone
of the Londoner.
By means of the
District Railway
and the London
and South Western
Railway he
can get at any
part of it, and
trams are yearly
stretching out
further and further, so that he can go above
ground, if he wishes, all the way to Hampton. At
Hampton itself, at Richmond and Kew, there are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178'>[178]</a></span>
large open spaces once the gardens or parks
belonging to kings, but now open as public
pleasure grounds, ideal places for the man who has
a small family to take with him, and whose holiday
is limited to a day. For those who are free from
encumbrances, there are always boats to be had in
abundance, at a much cheaper rate than one would
have to pay for them at, say, Maidenhead; and the
scenery itself, though not so fine as some higher
up, is pleasant and attractive. If the day be wet
or uncertain there is the palace at Hampton to
explore; and accommodation for eating and drinking
is amply supplied by numerous inns and hotels
clustering round its gates.
</p>

<p>
The gateway to the Palace is imposing, with its
brick piers and stone heraldic animals, and the long
low range of buildings on the left side makes a strip
of bright colour.
</p>

<p class="caption">HAMPTON COURT FROM THE RIVER
</p>
</div>

<p>
The older part of the palace was built by Wolsey,
but by far the greater part of it, as it now stands, is
due to William III. Some parts of the entrance
gateway and the great hall are all that remain
to speak of Wolsey's inconceivable boldness in
attempting to build a palace which should outshine
that of a jealous monarch like Henry VIII.
Skelton's satire, beginning:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'>[179]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Why come ye not to courte?
</p>
<p>
To which courte?

<p>
To the kinge's courte,
</p>
<p>
Or to Hampton Courte?
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
showed what everyone thought, and doubtless
served to concentrate attention upon Wolsey's
temerity. The irony of the matter lay in the fact
that the palace was not seized, but that the unfortunate
owner was forced to make a present of it to
the King:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
With turrettes and with toures,
</p>
<p>
With halls and with boures
</p>
<p>
Stretching to the starres,
</p>
<p>
With glass windows and barres;
</p>
<p>
Hanginge about their walles
</p>
<p>
Clothes of gold and palles
</p>
<p>
Fresh as floures in Maye.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Whether he gave the palace as it stood, with its
"two hundred and four score beds, the furniture of
most being of silk," is not recorded; but it is probable
that when he had been wrought up to the
pitch of terror necessary for overcoming his reluctance
to part with his beautiful new possession, he
would give all&mdash;everything&mdash;feeling that so long
as his life was safe it was all he cared about. As a
mark of royal favour, Henry allowed him to occupy
apartments at Richmond, where he was not too
far off to observe the doings of the monarch in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180'>[180]</a></span>
his palace. The king was so pleased with his
new establishment that he formed a mighty park,
embracing all the land for miles around, including
East and West Molesey, Cobham, Esher, Byfleet,
and Thames Ditton, and was sorely aggrieved
because his loving subjects, whose land and rights
had thus been confiscated, dared to make an outcry.
</p>

<p>
Edward VI. was born at Hampton. After his
death Queen Mary came here with her husband
Philip, and the unhappy couple, one full of sullen
hate, the other sore and bitter in her loneliness,
must have strolled in the grounds many a time.
</p>

<p>
For three months King Charles I. was held
prisoner here while his fate was undecided, and
when he was removed it was to go up the river to
Maidenhead, where he said his last farewell to his
children. Oliver Cromwell, who, though he dared
not take the name of king, had no dislike to the
royal privileges, lived at Hampton, and one of his
daughters was married from the palace. But by
the time of William III., much of the building
had fallen into decay. The situation was
pleasant, and though Henry's park had in great
part reverted to its rightful owners, there was still
much open ground around which made the place
desirable. William had a passion for building, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
loved the prim Dutch style, as was natural. The
maze and the canal, and the long avenues of trees
in Bushey, are all evidences of his taste. But in
the palace he attempted to copy Versailles, as he
had already copied it at Kensington. Poor Wren
must have been as much perplexed as ever he was
in his life when told to remodel a Tudor building
into the copy of one of the Renaissance, and that
he succeeded at all is greatly to his credit. Two
out of the five courts which remained of the old
palace were pulled down, and the state rooms, as
we now see them, are the work of Wren under
William's directions. Since then the interest and
beauty of the interior has been much added to by
the famous collection of pictures, which attracts at
least as many visitors as the building does.
</p>

<p>
Bushey Park adjoins Hampton, and lies so close
to the river that it forms part of the river scenery.
Its glory is in its great double line of chestnuts,
with the broad sweep of green grass lining the
avenues formed by them. Chestnut Sunday, when
the trees are in bloom, is a well-known date in the
Londoner's calendar, and every description of conveyance
is hired, chartered, or borrowed, to see the
great sight. Hundreds of people, to whom it is
one of the great days in the year, walk about or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>[182]</a></span>
eat refreshments beneath the sombre green masses
which are lightened by a thousand pyramidal
candles. The central avenue is one mile and forty
yards in length, and the width of it is fifty-six
yards. A noble conception, worthy of the little
man with the wise head. On Hampton Green,
outside the gates of the palace, Sir Christopher
Wren passed the last five years of his life, in sight
of his greatest architectural problem.
</p>

<p>
Molesey Lock, just above the bridge, is a popular
place in summer. All those who have come down
to enjoy the fresh air, and who want an excuse for
doing nothing, stand and watch the boats passing
through; there is always as great a crowd on the
tow-path as on the water. A number of islands
lie above the lock, the largest of which is Tagg's, as
well known as any island on the river, and much
patronised by holiday-makers at lunch and tea
time. In summer a band plays on the lawn twice
a week. It is opposite the end of the Hurst Park
Racecourse, patronised by altogether a different type
of people from those who come to Hampton Court,
and who can only be said to belong to the river
accidentally, by reason of the position of the course.
A wonderful club boat-house of polished wood
has sprung up of recent years on the Hampton
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'>[183]</a></span>
side, and above it is Garrick's Villa with portico
and columns. This the great actor bought in 1754,
and kept until his death, after which his widow
lived in it for another forty years. He was visited
here by all the celebrated men of his time, including
Horace Walpole, Dr. Johnson and Hogarth, and
here he gave a splendid series of river fêtes. The
little temple on the bank was built by him as a
shrine for a statue of Shakespeare, which has now
been removed. A small public garden on the edge
of the water makes this a favourite lounging place
for the people of the neighbourhood. The scenery is
rather tame, but has that charm always to be found
in flowing water and green grass, in the absence of
chimneys and other horrors of man's making.
</p>

<p>
The church of Hampton village stands up fairly
high above the water. It is in a most unlovely
style, but ivy has done something to smooth down
its defects, which are further toned by distance.
There is a ferry close by, and as this is the nearest
point to the station, many of those who arrive by
train on race-days cross at this point, and the ferrymen
reap rich harvests.
</p>

<p>
Not far beyond this loom up the great earthworks
and reservoirs of the West Middlesex and
Grand Junction Water Company, and with that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
the influence of Hampton may be said to cease.
</p>

<p>
Returning again to the bridge at Hampton, we
have the river Mole flowing in on the right bank.
Molesey Regatta takes place every year in July.
The trees and red brickwork of the palace are on
the left, and only a short way down is the pretty
little oasis of Thames Ditton, which somehow seems
as if it ought to belong to the river much higher
up, and had fallen here by mistake. The Swan
Inn is right on the edge of the water. It is proud
of the fact that Theodore Hook wrote a verse on a
pane of glass at a time when such things were quite
legitimate, because the tourist, as we know him,
had not then come into existence to vulgarise the
practice. The pane has been broken, but the
verse is remembered, and the following lines are a
sample:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
The Swan, snug inn, good fare affords
</p>
<p class="i1">
  As table e'er was put on,
</p>
<p>
And worthier quite of loftier boards,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Its poultry, fish and mutton.
</p>
<p>
And while sound wine mine host supplies,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  With ale of Meux and Tritton,
</p>
<p>
Mine hostess with her bright blue eyes
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Invites to stay at Ditton.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
We wonder how many hostesses since have
wished the lines had never been written. An old
inn near by, with overhanging gable end and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
clinging wistaria, makes a pretty corner, and in the
High Street itself there are bits so different from
the Kingston and Surbiton ideal, that one cannot
understand how they can be in the same zone with
them at all. The green lawns of Ditton House
and Boyle Farm are quite close, and the fine
island with its willows hides the flatness of the
further bank.
</p>

<p>
About the end of the eighteenth century this
part of the river was celebrated for its magnificent
fêtes.
</p>

<p>
One of these, given at Boyle Farm, inspired
Moore to write a poem which was not published
until long after:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Lamps of all hues, from walks and bowers,
</p>
<p>
Broke on the eye like kindling flowers

<p>
Bore its full fruit of brilliancy.

The reach is a favourite one for sailing boats.
Below Long Ditton are the large waterworks of
the Lambeth Company. On fine Saturdays and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'>[186]</a></span>
Sundays the Hampton tow-path on the other side
is generally alive with people. On Raven's Ait is
the club-house of the Kingston Rowing Club, and
beside the water runs a well laid out strip of ground
with bushes and seats, and a good stout hedge to
keep off the dust from the motor cars which race
by on the road&mdash;a section of the Ripley Road
beloved of scorchers. In summer this little public
garden is bright with flowers, and it is a great
favourite with the inhabitants of Kingston and
Surbiton. Before arriving at the bridge there are
the backs of untidy houses, and generally a great
medley of barges, laden with hay and bricks and
coal, lying about by the wharves.
</p>

<p>
Kingston, as we have said elsewhere, can boast
of one of the oldest bridges over the river. A
bridge of wood stood here in 1225, when there was
no other in the whole sweep downward as far as
London Bridge. The present one is very narrow,
and its convenience is not increased since a double
line of tramways has been laid across it. The
general similarity of position between it and
Richmond Bridge may be remarked. Both have
large boat-building establishments near, and both
are about the same distance from the railway
bridges which cross below them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>[187]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As this is not a guide-book, no attempt is made
to describe other than picturesque effects and
ancient survivals such as are likely to attract the
notice of anyone actually on the river, but an
exception must be made in favour of Kingston
Stone, which anyone ought to land to see. It is
in the market-place, not five minutes from the river,
and from it&mdash;the King's Stone&mdash;the name of the
place is derived. It is a shapeless block, mounted
on a granite base, and round it are inscribed the
names of seven Saxon kings who were crowned
here, and a silver penny of each of their reigns has
been inserted. There seems to be no authentic
history of this interesting relic, and no definite
explanation as to why these kings should have been
here crowned; but a suggestion there is that at the
date of the first of the coronations Mercia and
Wessex were joined under one king, and while the
boundaries of Mercia reached to the Thames on
the north side, those of Wessex marched with them
on the south. Kingston was equally accessible to
both, and as London was at that time in the hands
of the Danes, and the ford at Kingston the only
one above London by which the river could be
safely crossed, the place was chosen accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Teddington Lock was for a long time the lowest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>[188]</a></span>
on the river, but has been supplanted by a Benjamin
in the shape of a half-tide lock at Richmond. The
reach about Teddington is in the summer very
pretty. The banks are dotted with little bungalows,
bright with blue and white paint and gay
with flowers. The long smooth lawns of the riverside
houses stretch down to the water, and the
Crimson Rambler climbs over many a rustic bridge
and iron trellis. It is a well-cared for part, and
holds its own against rivals of greater grandeur.
There are several islands forming cover where one
can ship oars and rest, and though landing is in
most places forbidden, there is no law against a
boat's drawing inshore beneath the shelter of the
overhanging trees, amongst which may be noted
several weeping willows. This bit recalls Moore's:

</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
There is a great bend at Twickenham, and in it
the chimneys of Strawberry Hill may be seen overtopping
the high evergreen hedge that surrounds it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>[189]</a></span>
The house has been altered considerably since
Walpole's date, but in its essence it is the house he
built. He himself describes his view thus:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Directly before it is an open grove through which you
see a field, which is bounded by a serpentine wood of all
kind of trees, and flowering shrubs, and flowers. The
lawn before the house is situated on the top of a small hill
from whence to the left you see the town and church of
Twickenham, encircling a turn of the river, that looks
exactly like a seaport in miniature. The opposite shore
is a most delicious meadow, bounded by Richmond Hill,
which loses itself in the noble woods of the park to the
end of the prospect on the right, where is another turn of
the river, and the suburbs of Kingston as luckily placed as
Kingston is on the left.... You must figure that all
this is perpetually enlivened by a navigation of boats and
barges.
</p>
</div>

<p>
His architecture was a medley of everything that
could by any possibility be included under the
heading Gothic, and the result was more curious
than beautiful, though it became the fashion to
visit the house. Walpole bemoaned the crowds
aloud, but secretly delighted in them. He published
a description of the house, in the beginning
of which he says he trusts it will be a lesson in
taste to all who see it! An example of the suave
self-belief of an egotist. At Twickenham there is
another fantastic building called Pope's Villa. This
can be seen much better from the river than Strawberry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190'>[190]</a></span>
Hill can, and it is an affected piece of architecture.
It has been described as "a combination
of an Elizabethan half-timber house and a Stuart
Renaissance, with the addition of Dutch and Swiss,
Italian and Chinese features." This is not the
house occupied by Pope, nor is it even exactly on
the same site as his. In front of it is a group of
weeping willows, a kind of tree which shows to
particular advantage by the water-side. Pope
himself is said to have been the first to introduce
it into England, having found some sticks of it
in a bundle sent to him from Spain by the Countess
of Suffolk.
</p>

<p>
Pope lived at Twickenham from 1719 to
1744, and produced here most of his important
works, including the last books of his <i>Odyssey</i>,
the <i>Dunciad</i> and the famous <i>Essay on Man</i>.
He was here visited by Gay and Swift, and
many another contemporary whose name is still
held in estimation. He laid out his grounds in
a decorative way, and made a curious underground
grotto, which lies away from the water,
on the other side of the road. Among the
celebrated men who have, at one time or
another, lived at Twickenham are numbered
Henry Fielding, Dr. Donne, Sir Godfrey Kneller,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
Tennyson, and Turner. The last-named was very
fond of fishing, and used to fish a good deal in
this part of the river.
</p>

<p>
There is a little esplanade at Twickenham, shaded
by small horse-chestnuts, and in front lies the
famous Eel-pie Island, which vies with Tagg's in
summer popularity. The hotel has a pleasant
garden, but the rest of the island is, it must be
confessed, rather untidy, with several places for
building motor launches and many boat-houses.
At the small wharf opposite the church there are
nearly always barges unloading bricks or sand and
gravel. Yet the place has an air of dignity, perhaps
given to it by the old Perpendicular stone tower of
the church, so incongruously welded on to a red-brick
pedimented Georgian building. The architect
was the same who built St. George's, Hanover
Square; but, as Sir Godfrey Kneller was churchwarden,
one might have expected something in
better taste. Pope is buried inside, and a flat slab
with his initial letter on it now serves as a base for
several pews. Not far from the church is York
House, and with Orleans and Ham House on the
other side of the river this is a notable group. In
the great gardens of Orleans House grow splendid
cedars, stone pines, and other evergreens. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192'>[192]</a></span>
little Duke of Gloucester, the only child who
survived babyhood out of Queen Anne's enormous
family, was brought here for his health in 1694.
Six years later this quaint child, with a rickety
body and an enormous head, died of small-pox at
the age of eleven. The house was afterwards
rebuilt. To it in 1800 came Louis Philippe, then
Duc d'Orleans, and his two brothers. After his
brief summer of prosperity in France, he returned
to England as an exile in 1848; that he had a
warm remembrance of the house is shown by his
then purchasing it. He did not, however, live
here himself, but placed his son, the Duc d'Aumale,
in it, and a colony of royal refugees settled round.
At Mount Lebanon, not far off, was the Prince de
Joinville; and the Duc d'Aumale, having bought
York House, gave it to his nephew the Comte de
Paris, who lived there for six or seven years. Queen
Anne was born in York House&mdash;it had been given
to her mother's father, Lord Clarendon&mdash;and with
her elder sister she spent her earliest years at
Twickenham. All these notable houses and dignified
memories are enough to account for the air of
sober gravity never wholly absent from the river at
Twickenham even on the brightest days; and the
rows of Lombardy poplars, the magnificent cedars,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>[193]</a></span>
and the fine foliage of the other trees enhance
the impression. Ham House, on the other side,
was built in 1611, it is said for Prince Henry,
James I.'s eldest son. It is screened from the
water by a row of tall trees. Around it grow
Scotch firs and holm oaks.
</p>

<p>
We have not long left Twickenham before we
see the little oblong island about which there was
so much contention because it formed an item in
the famous Marble Hill view, seen from the heights
of Richmond Park. The London County Council
are now owners of the Marble Hill estate, and
have made it into a public park. It lies on the
Twickenham side. The house was built by
George II. for the Countess of Suffolk. Gay,
Pope, and Swift all took an interest in the building,
and voiced their opinions as to the style and the
laying out of the grounds. A suite of rooms in
the house was afterwards set aside for Gay, who
was a great favourite with the countess.
</p>

<p>
The other side of the river is open, and it must
be admitted that on a sunny day this bit is a stiff
pull if one is unfortunate enough to be going
against the current. It is often to be described
by the word "glaring," yet the fine scimitar-like
sweep of the tree-crowned heights above, capped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194'>[194]</a></span>
by the huge mass of the Star and Garter Hotel,
toned to unoffending mediocrity of colour, is worth
seeing.
</p>

<p>
Richmond, like nearly all the other places on
the river, has an atmosphere of its own, difficult
to put into words. It is less flippant than Kingston,
and has not a tinge of the gravity of
Twickenham. The houses rise high and are
irregular; those in the main street recede from
the water as they leave the bridge, and between
them and the stream are innumerable others, some
with gardens, some overshadowed by trees. Weeping
willows, Scotch firs, and ivy-covered trunks
abound, and the place is the perfection of a
residential quarter. There is enough oldness and
irregularity to avoid stiffness, enough modernity
to ensure cleanliness. The bridge has a peculiarly
individual curve&mdash;a real humpback&mdash;and its stone
balustrade is very fine. At the southern end, far
too many new red-brick flats are springing up,
alas! but on the north or east, where lies old
Richmond, they are not visible to any appreciable
extent. The scene below the bridge is distinctly
pretty. Large boat-building yards, as at Kingston,
occupy the foreground, and the warm cinnamons
and ochres of newly-varnished boats are generally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195'>[195]</a></span>
to be seen, as well as the more crude and garishly
painted craft. The islands are tree-covered, and
are well placed in the stream. Yet one may note
that, popular as Richmond is, it is not flooded in
the summer time with such crowds of boating
visitors as Hampton. There are more large craft
about, and boating people do not care for that.
</p>

<p>
What remains of Richmond Palace must be
sought below the bridge, for it will not be seen
without a little effort. The old palace stood right
on the margin of the water, and an engraving of
it is still extant, showing a pinnacled and many
chimneyed building. The angular towers are
capped by turrets like those of the old palace at
Greenwich. Henry I. was the first English king
to live here, but until Edward III.'s time it was
hardly a recognised royal palace. It fell before
the hand of Richard II., who in a fit of frenzy at
the death of his wife, which occurred here, ordered
its destruction. Henry V. restored it, but it was
burnt down in the end of the fifteenth century,
and afterwards rebuilt by Henry VII., who changed
its name from Sheen to Richmond, and who himself
died there. The old Tudor gateway of his
time remains still. It is said, but with doubtful
accuracy, that the Countess of Nottingham died
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196'>[196]</a></span>
in the room over the gateway, after having
confessed to Elizabeth her duplicity about the
Earl of Essex and the ring he had confided to her
charge. We have many records of Richmond
from the time of the miserable Katherine of
Arragon&mdash;widow of one boy prince, but not yet
affianced to the other, a foreigner in a strange
land, bitterly hating her surroundings&mdash;to the time
of Charles I., who made the great park and hunted
in it. A large Carthusian monastery stood near
the palace. Perkin Warbeck found an asylum in
the monastery, and in 1550 Robert Dudley was
here married to Amy Robsart.
</p>

<p>
There is a half-tide lock at Richmond, with a
footbridge. This is at present the lowest lock on
the river, though there is some talk of making
a similar one at Wandsworth. It is quite different
in construction from the usual kind. It has three
great sluices, each weighing thirty-two tons, and
when the tide brings up the water, so that it is
equal with that above&mdash;that is to say, at half-tide&mdash;the
sluices are raised by the addition of a small
weight to the massive pendules by which they are
exactly balanced, and the water is allowed free way.
</p>

<p>
All along this stretch of the river there is on
one side a fine row of shady trees growing to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197'>[197]</a></span>
great height. Beyond the raised footpath is the
old Deer Forest, on which stands Kew Observatory,
and a minor stream, which afterwards forms
a moat to Kew Gardens, runs along merrily.
Isleworth is finely placed at a bend of the river,
and though it is a manufacturing place, it is not
so bad as Brentford. The large willow-covered
ait in front affords occupation to the osier gatherers.
The church is ugly; it is placed very like that at
Hampton, and, like Hampton also, its ugliness is
mitigated by a covering of ivy. The tower, as
so frequently happens, is much older than the rest.
Was it that church towers were built more solidly
than the naves, or that the naves would have stood
equally well had they been allowed to remain?
</p>

<p>
Then we come to the great park surrounding
Syon House (Duke of Northumberland), a park
fringed with marshy ground, where reeds and
rushes flourish, and which is overflowed at every
flood. Crows consider it a delightful place, if
their perpetual presence may be taken to indicate
opinion. A great clump of cedars stands between
the house and the river, but we have to go
considerably further on before the severe line of
frontage, with its ground floor arcade and battlemented
parapet, can be seen at full length. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198'>[198]</a></span>
astonished lion stands clear up against the sky, as
he did of old at Northumberland House, over the
site of which now flows a ceaseless stream of traffic.
Long years ago there stood here at Isleworth a
convent for nuns. This was suppressed at the
Dissolution. Katherine Howard was imprisoned
in Syon House until three days before her execution,
and only five years later the corpse of her
murderer, the tyrant Henry, stopped here on its
way to Windsor. Edward VI. granted the place
to Lord-Protector Somerset, who, with his usual
mania for building, began to reconstruct it on
a much larger scale; but before he had got farther
than the mere shell of his design, he suffered
disgrace, and Syon House passed to the Duke of
Northumberland. Here came Lady Jane Grey,
timid and doubting, to receive the offer of the
crown, and from here she started on her last sad
journey to the Tower.
</p>

<p>
Queen Mary naturally tried to re-establish the
nuns, but found it difficult, as some had died and
others had married! Fuller's comment is worth
quoting:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It was some difficulty to stock it with such as had been
veiled before, it being now thirty years since the Dissolution,
in which time most of the elder nuns were in their graves,
and the younger in the arms of their husbands, as afterwards
embracing a married life.
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In James I.'s reign Syon House was in the hands
of the Earl of Northumberland, who also fell under
his sovereign's displeasure, but was allowed to
return here to die. Under his successor, the tenth
earl, Inigo Jones was employed to alter the house;
but the architect of the present building was Adam
(1728-92).
</p>

<p>
The place is often very quiet, and the hovering
crows, and perhaps a few men in boats grubbing
for sand and gravel from the river-bed with
long-handled scoops, have it all to themselves.
It is not much frequented because just below
comes Brentford, with all its ugliness, a sore blot
on the river. Nevertheless, on the Surrey side,
to counterbalance it, we have the famous Kew
Gardens. The very varied trees that grow here
can be well seen, for the parapet of the wall is
low, the Gardens being sufficiently protected by
the moat. Further on, when this comes to an end,
the wall is heightened, and only the tops of the
elms and ashes and horse-chestnuts peep over.
Presently a new object comes into view&mdash;a
"palace," in that it was the dwelling-place of
royalty; but anything less like a palace surely
never was seen. A stiff, square red-brick house,
where Miss Burney served her "sweet queen,"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
and the old king cried "What, what, what?" a
hundred times a day, and the overflowing quiverful
of their Royal Highnesses quarrelled and played
and grew up.
</p>

<p>
Very few people realise what a large basin there
is on the river Brent, and what an amount of
business is carried on here. From the river, one's
chief reflection is thankfulness that the trees on
the large islands have grown so well that they form
a screen for the soap factories, the cement works,
the breweries, etc., which constitute the industries
of Brentford.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Brentford, tedious town,
</p>
<p>
For dirty streets and white-legged chickens known,
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
says Gay. The dirty streets are still there, with
the confusion in their narrow limits worse confounded
by the passing of tramcars, which, over
the mile along which Brentford spreads itself, take
double the time spent on any other bit of equal
distance on their route. Most people have a hazy
notion about two kings at Brentford; this is one
of those curious examples of the persistence of an
unimportant detail. The allusion was first made
in a play called <i>The Rehearsal</i>, written by the
Duke of Buckingham, and Thackeray's ballad on
the same subject carried it a step further. That
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>[201]</a></span>
there was a battle at Brentford one learns in the
history books. It was when the Parliamentarians,
who had rested in the town all night, were surprised
by Prince Rupert, under the cover of a thick mist,
and completely routed.
</p>

<p>
All along the Kew side, up to the bridge, are
tea-gardens sandwiched between boat-houses; and
the new bridge made of granite, with its branching
lamps and royal arms, is really an imposing object.
Above and below the bridge the character of the
river is singularly different. Above, as we have
seen, are the mudflats, and wharves, and chimneys,
not to omit water towers and gasometers; and
below is a bit of Chiswick, built along by the
waterside, a queer little irregular row of red-brick
houses and cottages, near which are fastened the
boats of men who live by fishing; it is a little
riverside place of the old sort. There are meadows,
called Duke's Meadows, opposite Mortlake; these
afford a fine vantage-ground for spectators who
come to see the great Boat Race.
</p>

<p>
The hour of the Boat Race varies according
to the tide, for the race is rowed at the "top of
the tide"&mdash;when it is at its fullest. If the hour
be an easy one&mdash;about mid-day&mdash;and the weather
is promising, and especially if the reports of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>[202]</a></span>
prowess of the crews give reason to believe the
race will be a close one, then the crowd is very
large indeed. Some prefer to watch the start;
some enthusiasts keep up with the boats on
water the whole way; but a great majority there
are who want to see the last effort between
Hammersmith and Barnes Bridges, for it is almost
a certainty that the crew leading at Barnes Bridge
will be the winner. Almost, but not quite; for
there was an occasion when, by a sudden spurt, the
positions of the boats were reversed, and Cambridge,
which had been behind, won the race. The road
along by Mortlake is lined with crowds; every
window is filled, and all available roofs. On the
railway bridge are closely-packed ranks of people,
brought there and deposited by trains, which afterwards
decorously withdraw and wait to pick them
up again. The price of this first-rate position is
included in the fares. Chiswick meadows afford
space for many more persons, who usually pay
a shilling a head to the land-holders. This is a
very favourite position, because the grassy slopes
form such a pleasant seat while the inevitable
waiting is gone through.
</p>

<p>
In the river itself lie several steamers packed
with passengers, and also various small boats.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
Then down comes the launch of the Thames
Conservators to clear the course. The long strings
of barges, which have been taking advantage of
the flowing tide to make their way up-stream,
are seen no more. A gun goes off, and then, an
extraordinarily short time after, a murmur begins
among the crowds on the Mortlake side. It grows
and grows and swells along the Chiswick shore, as
first one boat creeps round the corner, and then
the other. "Cambridge wins; Cambridge, Cambridge!"
"Row up, Oxford!"
</p>

<p>
Then, perhaps&mdash;usually&mdash;it is seen that one boat
is leading by so many lengths as to make it impossible
for the other to catch up. The leading boat
goes ahead with a straight, splendid swing into clear
water. The losing one, getting into its opponent's
wash, rocks as it labours on, its crew lose heart, and
the distance widens.
</p>

<p>
Close behind are the umpire's launch and a
dozen others gliding along, keeping just behind
the backward crew. And when all have passed,
the river, so calm before, is churned up into miniature
waves that wash and beat on the banks.
Presently the umpire's boat is seen coming swiftly
back, bearing the winning flag at the bows over
the other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>[204]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The trains move slowly forward to pick up the
passengers; bicycles, motors, and carriages begin
to move off; streams of people pour down every
road; and all is over for another year.
</p>

<p>
The chief memory of Chiswick is that of Hogarth,
who is buried in the churchyard close by the water.
The house in which he lived is still standing, and
is a few minutes' walk from the church. Hogarth
was here for about three years, though when he
left to go to Leicester Square he did not sell the
house, and his widow lived in it after his death.
For two years Pope also lived in Chiswick; and
in Chiswick House, which lies away from the river
on the other side of the fields, two great men,
Charles James Fox and George Canning, died in
the same room, in 1806 and 1827 respectively.
And in the Roman Catholic Cemetery at Mortlake
is the massive sarcophagus&mdash;in the form of an
Arab tent&mdash;beneath which lies the dust of the
great traveller, Sir Richard Burton, and his wife.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>[205]</a></span>

CHAPTER XVIII<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
THE RIVER AT LONDON
</span></h2>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i395" id="i395"></a>
<img src="images/i-395.jpg" width="328" height="409" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
There is a subtle
difference in the
river above and
below Hammersmith:
above, it
is a stream of
pleasure&mdash;below,
it is something
less beautiful, but
grander, more
crowded with
memories, more
important.
</p>

<p>
Though pleasure
boats are to be seen in quantities any summer
evening about Putney; though market gardens
still border the banks at Fulham; yet the river
is for the greater part lined with wharves and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'>[206]</a></span>
piers and embankments. It is no wild thing
running loose, but a strong worker full of
earnest purpose. It is the great river without
which there would have been no London, the
river which bears the largest trade the world has
ever known.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the habit of using the river at
London as a highway was lost some time in the
eighteenth century and has not yet been recovered,
notwithstanding the gallant attempt of the London
County Council to educate the people to it. At
one time the river was used for every sort of
traffic: tilt boats, covered with an awning, ran up
and down like omnibuses and charged sixpence a
passenger; and every man of importance kept his
private barge, for the smoothly gliding waters
made an infinitely preferable route to the vile
roads. At every set of stairs&mdash;and the stairs
were frequent&mdash;numberless wherries awaited hire.
In the sixteenth century there were two thousand
on the water, and it was reckoned that nine
thousand watermen earned their living by transporting
people up and down or from shore to
shore. When it is objected that these men were a
pest and a nuisance, so that we are well rid of them,
that their language was unspeakable and their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
manners filthy, it may be replied, <i>autres temps
autres mœurs</i>, for there are a few watermen still
to be had at Westminster, at the Tower, and
at most of the river stairs, and they are civil
and obliging, only, alas, the public rarely patronises
them. Occasionally, an uncommonly adventurous
person, probably a visitor staying in London,
penetrates to the haunt of the watermen, and,
upon inquiry, he finds a respectable man, duly
licensed like a cabman, liable to be reported for
rudeness or misconduct, strictly limited by law
as to the fees he may demand, and ready to add
greatly to the pleasure of the trip by his genial,
shrewd humour and his keen observation; qualities
found frequently in men whose business is upon
great waters.

<p class="caption">BEYOND HAMMERSMITH BRIDGE
</p>
</div>

<p>
Without counting the railways, fourteen bridges
now span the Thames from Hammersmith downward,
and even fourteen we sometimes find
inadequate to our needs in this hurrying life. Not
until the middle of the eighteenth century was
the historic London Bridge backed up by a second.
Before that time, all men crossed by boat, or by
the ferry at Westminster, or even by the ford
there, a feat which the embanking of the river
has long rendered impossible.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>[208]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We can see it, this great river of ours, as in
a vision, gradually emerging from its primeval
wilderness. First it spread widely between the
rising ground on each side, a vast area of lagoons,
flooded at high tide, and at low tide a swampy
place full of half-submerged islets. Then one or
two small settlements for trade were planted on
its banks, first at Westminster, and others about
the site of Cannon Street Station, where the
Walbrook leapt to meet the larger current. There
was a gradual extension of houses along the
brink. At last an attempt was made to bridge
the river over, probably by a wooden bridge.
This succeeded, and when the bridge had stood
for some time it was replaced by another in
the twelfth century. This was built and rebuilt,
as the turbulent river, feeling the erection of
earthworks to curtail its flood, fretted to be free,
and rushed seaward with force, tearing down the
obstruction offered by this quaint old London
Bridge with its double line of houses. Many a
picture of this bridge still remains. It was a
fascinating, a wonderful structure. Numberless
children have yearned to have lived there, high
above the flood. What delight to look out from
one's nursery window and see the grey-green
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>[209]</a></span>
water hastening past. To see it mysteriously
stop as if by some command from on High, then
slowly turn and race inward again. Marvellous
feat! Miraculous bridge! There was a beautiful
chapel, a veritable gem of work, upon this bridge.
There was a house like a puzzle-house, put
together with pegs, without an iron nail in it.
There were gateways at each end, and on the
gateways were the grisly remains of the heads of
men and women who had been executed. There
were shops on each side of the road where ribbons
and laces and other haberdashery might be bought
at will.

<p class="caption">THE CUSTOM HOUSE
</p>
</div>

<p>
There were gaps between the houses, where
one could escape for a moment from the lumbering,
creaking, groaning traffic pent up in the
narrow, mud-splashed roadway, and see the water
itself, and see how the houses were built out
over it, resting on nothing. Another miracle!
A mighty tome might be written about Old
London Bridge; of all the relics of a past London,
it is the one I should like most to have seen.
Mills there were on this bridge, to which the
people could bring their corn to be ground by the
force of the water. Waterworks there were, too,
and the bridge itself contained a drawbridge to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>[210]</a></span>
protect London against invasion, for, as there was
none other crossing, an enemy prevented here
might well be held in check altogether.
</p>

<p>
Next to London Bridge, the oldest bridge across
the river was at Kingston, and it is on record that
in 1554, Sir Thomas Wyatt, finding London
Bridge closed against him, marched all the way
to Kingston in order to cross, but on arrival
there, found that he had been anticipated, and
that the bridge was broken down.
</p>

<p>
The present London Bridge has been recently
widened. At one end of it rises the white tower
of St. Magnus, a Danish saint, and behind it is
the pointing finger of the Monument, while down
the river are the market of Billingsgate, the quay
of the Custom House, and beyond, rising tall and
ghostly, close to the Tower itself, the Tower Bridge,
the latest addition to the list.
</p>

<p>
On the south side of London Bridge, over the
houses peep the pinnacles of St. Saviour's tower,
Southwark. Anciently, it was called St. Mary
Overies, and was once a priory, one of the most
ancient houses in London. From this there ran
a ferry, which was in use long after the bridge
was built, for the narrowness of the street and the
continual blocks made a passage by the bridge a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211'>[211]</a></span>
process of time. Gower, the poet, was a benefactor
to the priory, and is buried in the church.

<p>
As the Tower Bridge can swing open, ships of
all sizes can get up as far as London Bridge, when
the tide allows them sufficient water-way, and
a busy scene, watched by a never-failing crowd of
idlers, is always to be witnessed in the reach
below. Ships there are of all shapes and sizes,
but mostly hideous, made for merchandise and
not for show. Many of them are iron, and
run between eight and twelve hundred tons.
They come from Hamburg, Hull, Newcastle,
Holland, and many another port. There, out in
the river, is a dredger working with a hideous grinding
noise, and beyond it are two or three brilliantly
painted green and red boats with great wooden
flaps, or lee boards, on their sides. They are
Dutch eel boats, and are allowed to lie in the river
free from dues, if they keep always in the same
place. It is a survival of an ancient custom.
</p>

<p>
As we pass through under London Bridge, and
come out on the other side, we can see the grey
river with its bustling craft, framed like a series
of pictures in the wide arches.
</p>

<p>
Some of the oldest theatres in London stood
on the part called Bankside, about Southwark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>[212]</a></span>
Bridge; at present the view is dingy and uninteresting.
The Bishop of Winchester's palace once
adjoined Bankside, as that of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, at Lambeth, still stands near Westminster
Bridge; but it fell into ruins and the
bishops removed to Chelsea.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to enumerate the palaces and
fine houses that once stood along Thames Street,
which, in the fourteenth century, was the most
fashionable street in London. The part of the
foreshore now occupied by wharves and great
warehouses&mdash;where cranes swing and lighters await
their loads all day long, and every working day&mdash;has
all been reclaimed from the river. Once it
was covered at every returning tide, but strong
piles were driven into the mud, and on this
unpromising spot houses began to rise and débris
accumulated, until firm ground was made, and
this became one side of a busy street.
</p>

<p>
On the up-side of Cannon Street, close to the
cavernous jaws of the station, is a wharf marked
in white letters, "Walbrook Wharf." This is as
near as we can get to the first site of London,
where the Briton made his modest lake-fort,
Llyn-din, and afterwards the Romans pitched
their strong citadel.

<p>
Queenhithe was given by King John to his
mother, Queen Eleanor. Hence arose the name.
It was no trifling gift, for this was the most
important dock on the Thames at that time, and
dues were collected from all the ships unlading
here. Now it is a small area in which the water
laps at rotting lichened posts as it slowly uncovers
and re-covers the slimy mud.
</p>

<p>
The whole of this district lying north of the
Thames is the oldest part of our ancient city,
and it is thick with memories. Down the crooked
streets Spenser came as a boy from his home
beyond the city ditch to his school of the Merchant
Taylors in Dowgate. Here a fair-haired gentle
lad, called Chaucer, loitered many a time, for his
father's house was in Thames Street.
</p>

<p>
Not far from Puddle dock stood Baynard's
Castle with its high buttressed walls. In it
Edward IV. was proclaimed, and in it, also,
Richard III. made a feint of refusing the crown
belonging to his imprisoned nephew. Tower
Royal, Montfichet, and many another glorious
building, have gone utterly, so that their sites
can be fixed only approximately. The river Fleet,
up which large ships could ply once, flowed into
the Thames where is now Blackfriars Bridge. By
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214'>[214]</a></span>
its banks the great religious houses of the Black
and White Friars rose, and the boundary cliff
hewed by its current may still be traced in the
steep rise up Ludgate Hill, which tries the patient
omnibus horses day by day. Over all, as we
draw further up the river, towers the great dome
of St. Paul's.
</p>

<p>
The Surrey side of the Thames continues
unlovely&mdash;a medley of browns and greys, tall
chimneys and tumble-down sheds; it needs the
veil which the atmosphere of London mercifully
throws over it.
</p>

<p>
The railway bridge and Blackfriars are so close
together, they almost touch. As we pass underneath
there is a hollow reverberation, like the
beat of the surf in a cave on the shore. Just
above the bridge is anchored the <i>Buzzard</i>, the
Naval Volunteer training ship.

<p>
Along the northern side now begins the
Embankment, with its solid granite walls and
fringe of young planes. The green lawns and
red buildings of the Temple can be seen only
when the river is very high. Further on is
Somerset House, followed by a line of hotels,
the palaces of modern days. Somerset House is
the successor of the palace built by the arrogant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'>[215]</a></span>
Protector Somerset, from the stones of churches
and religious buildings; between it and the Temple
stood Arundel and Essex Houses. The latter had
earlier been called Leicester House, and Spenser
lived there for a time as secretary to the Earl of
Leicester.
</p>

<p>
The tide has turned and is coming in. Little
steam tugs, gallantly towing six barges, two
abreast and each twice as large as themselves, pant
up stream; while the bargees, with faces the
colour of brickdust, the colour they are so fond
of reproducing in their paint and even in their
sails, stand by their huge rudders. Some barges
are struggling along without mechanical aid. The
men in charge bend back horizontally in their
manipulation of the huge sweeps. There must be
a knack in it. No one could work so hard as they
seem to be doing; spine and sinews would give
way altogether. Their whole strength results in
but a slow progress, and the barge, responding to
the push of the water, makes a kind of crab-like
movement, sidling up the river broadside on. One,
laden with yellow straw till it appears like a huge
barn, is stranded right in mid-stream. The long
ends of the straw sweep in the water, and there
is no moving until the current increases.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>[216]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Here and there red-brown sails, patched and
stained, spring up, and others still furled, stand
up along the wharves like crooked warning fingers.
Just before Waterloo Bridge there is, neatly
tucked away below the Embankment, so that
few ever know of its existence, a station of the
river police, with trim muslin curtains over the
windows.
</p>

<p>
Between Waterloo and Charing Cross Bridges
the same sort of thing continues. An enormous
chimney on the Surrey side mocks the dignity
of Cleopatra's Needle, now safe in haven after
many vicissitudes. The sweep of the river makes
these two bridges radiate out like the spokes of
a wheel, so that the southern ends are nearer
than the northern. The chimneys and wharves
and the ubiquitous barges still continue, and as
we pass beneath the hideous red iron bridge of
Charing Cross, we get a vision of the many towers
and pinnacles of Westminster ahead.

<p class="caption">THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT
</p>
</div>

<p>
Besides the great houses of old times already
mentioned, there were others down this stretch
of the river too&mdash;the Savoy, home of John of
Gaunt, and in its time prison and hospital;
Durham, Worcester, and Salisbury Houses. These
were all either flush with the water or hemmed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217'>[217]</a></span>
in by high walls in which were stairs "to take
water at." The only relic of these mansions
lies in the watergate of York House, now about
a hundred yards from the river, behind a strip
of land which has all been reclaimed by the
making of the Embankment. But that the
Embankment does not always suffice to curb
the current was proved not so long ago, for
in March, 1906, there was a combination of
circumstances which swelled the volume of water
abnormally. Sudden floods of rain caused every
weir far up the river to be opened, and bounding,
exulting to be free, the huge mass of water,
swelled by every brook and tributary and swollen
to twice its usual size, rushed seaward. But it
was met by a high spring tide, and the collision
was increased by a strong wind, so that the water
rose higher and higher, and the curious spectacle
was witnessed of barges floating above the roadway,
propelled by sweeps braced against the
granite walls. The water burst up through the
pavement and the manholes, and ran in a flood
under Charing Cross Bridge, but it just did not
overtop the Embankment wall by an inch or two,
and as the tide subsided the tension relaxed. In
the higher reaches, about Barnes and Chiswick,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
"tide-boards" were used to fill up the crevices
below the doors, and by this means alone many
a house was saved from being swamped.
</p>

<p>
The scene is lively enough. Seagulls of all
ages&mdash;big dingy drab ones and neat ones in
liveries of dove-grey and white&mdash;float merrily on
the ripples, or poise and wheel in the air. Here
a County Council steamer ploughs past, churning
the river into wavelets, there a lad paddles a
boat from shore to shore with a single oar
used rudderwise, a feat possible only to a born
waterman.

<p>
As we pass on we can see the high bastion
towers of Scotland Yard. Northumberland Avenue
stretches over ground which was once the gardens
of Northumberland House&mdash;they came down to
the water&mdash;and beyond this were quadrangles
and a medley of buildings, mostly low and
mostly of brick, which formed the palace of
Whitehall, snatched by Henry VIII. from
Wolsey because the royal palace at Westminster
had fallen into decay. The Houses of Parliament,
standing on the site of the latter palace, are
the finest work of Barry, who has been abused
for many things, but who seems to have been
touched by a genuine spirit of architecture in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>[219]</a></span>
this instance, and to have realised the right
characteristics of majesty and delicacy in his
work. But he had a noble chance, for the
position of the building, standing on the edge
of the water, with the bridge rising beside it,
gave room for a fine conception.
</p>

<p>
From Westminster to the Tower or Fleet
prison, how many prisoners have come and
gone&mdash;come up against the current full of hope,
and returned of hope bereft! The ghosts are
endless, because the river was the usual mode of
communication between the Tower and the Court
at Westminster, as the Strand was full of holes
and seamed by watercourses. If this reach of
water were to tell its tale, much of the history
of England would be interwoven with it, and
it would be tinged with the bitterest sorrow
human life can know&mdash;death with disgrace.
</p>

<p>
From the time of Edward the Confessor to
the time of Henry VIII., our kings were housed
at Westminster as one of the chief of their royal
palaces. Luckily the Great Hall, which Rufus
built, escaped the fire of 1834, and still may
be seen, but all else, with the exception of the
crypt of St. Stephen's, has vanished utterly.
</p>

<p>
The time to see the Houses of Parliament
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>[220]</a></span>
is undoubtedly at night, when Big Ben's
illuminated face sheds a sort of ethereal light
on the architectural fretwork near him.
</p>

<p>
Wordsworth admired the view most in the
early morning, before the first waking of the
great world of bustle and business:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
</p>
<p>
Ships, towers, domes, theatres and temples lie
</p>
<p>
Open unto the fields and to the sky,
</p>
<p>
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
</p>
<p>
Never did sun more beautifully steep
</p>
<p>
In his first splendour, valley rock or hill;
</p>
<p>
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep;
</p>
<p>
The river glideth at his own sweet will.
</p>
<p>
Dear God, the very houses seem asleep;
</p>
<p>
And all that mighty heart is lying still.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Westminster Bridge is particularly wide, and
has a low parapet. In the sudden gusts of wind
that come sweeping down the river it is a marvel
that no one has been caught up and tossed over
into the rolling green torrent. These peculiarities
also are noticeable when the bridge is seen from
the Embankment, for the traffic looms up very
high on it, and the omnibuses and cabs look almost
as if they were careering along on the parapet
itself.
</p>

<p>
From Westminster to Lambeth is but a short
way, and what Westminster Palace was, while it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>[221]</a></span>
existed, to the lord temporal, so Lambeth has
been, and is, to the lord spiritual; from the very
earliest times the Archbishops of Canterbury have
lodged here.
</p>

<p>
In our peaceful days the holder of the highest
dignity of the Church has not to fear the Tower
and the "sharp medicine of the axe" as some
of his predecessors did. Laud and Juxon were
executed, and for Cranmer there was the worse
horror of the torturing stake. Lambeth has seen
much cruelty mingled with the name of religion in
the time that it has stood above the flood. The
Lollards, imprisoned within the tower which still
bears their name, made deep incisions on the walls
to wile away the weary hours of suspense, and the
groans of prisoners have been stifled by these walls
as well as by those of the grim Tower.
</p>

<p>
On the same side as Lambeth, nearer Westminster
Bridge, are the curious detached buildings
of St. Thomas's Hospital, looking like nothing in
the world less than a hospital.
</p>

<p>
Where Lambeth Bridge is now, was once the
ferry by which King James II. passed when he
made a hurried exit from the kingdom that repudiated
him. It was a bitter night, and, attended
by only one gentleman, the king slipped secretly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
out of his palace at Whitehall, and crossing the
Privy Gardens, made his way to the ferry, where
he entered a small boat with a single pair of oars.
In mid-stream he threw the Great Seal into the
water. A curious and dramatic incident this, that
might well be made the subject of a picture by
some historical painter. The Great Seal was afterwards
accidentally drawn up in the net of some
fisherman. But there is another memory further
back still, which gives to this strip of river an
importance which no other part can boast. Here
lay the first ford, to which all the traffic of the
north, on its way to the south coast, had to come.
In the ages before even the oldest London Bridge
was built, a string of pack horses, of weary men
and of travellers, continually wandered down through
the marshes lying around Thorney Island, on which
stands the present Abbey, and, guided by stakes
placed for the purpose, arrived at the river's bank,
there to await low tide, when they could cross over
to the further shore. Through the ages we see
them continuing, and when England was Christianised,
to the procession were added monks and
pilgrims bent on holy missions. When London
Bridge was built, a great majority of the age-long
procession was diverted that way, but many still
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
continued to prefer the ancient ford at Westminster.
Of course, since the Embankment was made,
and the river no longer wanders uncurbed over the
lowlands and meadows of Westminster, the current
runs deep and strong and no fording is possible.

<p>
Above Lambeth we pass the Tate Gallery and
the new bridge at Vauxhall, and then traverse a
dreary strip of river, dreary on both sides, until we
come near to Chelsea Bridge. This is a high-swinging
and imposing bridge of the same type as
the Albert Bridge further up. How different the
Chelsea we see now from the ancient Chelsea.
Ours is a Chelsea mainly of red brick, with many
tall flats and many beautifully designed houses in
pseudo-ancient style. A long line of planes runs
along the embankment, which is one of the prettiest
embankments on the river. The gardens and green
lawns of the Royal Hospital reach to the roadway,
and away behind them at some distance can be
seen the comparatively low and long range of
buildings dating from the time of the Stuarts, and
forming an asylum for old soldiers. On the strip
of ground to the east of them once stood Ranelagh,
the gay rotunda which played such a part in all
London flirtations; where misses met their beaux
and walked round in stately steps to the sound of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'>[224]</a></span>
music. The breakfasts at Ranelagh were at one
time almost as popular as the evening entertainments:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
A thousand feet rustled on mats,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  A carpet that had once been green;
</p>
<p>
Men bowed with their outlandish hats,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  With corners so fearfully keen;
</p>
<p>
Fair maids, who at home in their haste
</p>
<p class="i1">
  Had left all clothing else but a train,
</p>
<p>
Swept the floor clean as slowly they paced,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  And then walked round and swept it again.
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Thus Bloomfield satirically described the scene.
Ranelagh plays a large part in <i>Evelina</i> and other
romances of that date. The last public entertainment
was given in 1803, and of the gay rotunda
with its gorgeous fittings not a vestige now remains.
</p>

<p>
High red-brick flats which stand at the foot of
the Royal Hospital gardens by the river, are
succeeded by smaller houses, and beyond the
Albert Bridge the district has not yet been transformed,
as it assuredly will be.
</p>

<p>
In the small public gardens that face the river
there is a bronze statue of Carlyle, the Sage of
Chelsea, and not far off rises the curious little
tower of dark brick that belongs to the old church,
a very mausoleum of tombs. Chelsea has, perhaps,
been more altered by the formation of the Embankment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>[225]</a></span>
than any other part of the river. Its very
name implies a bank of shingly beach stretching
down to the water, and so it was in old times, and
to this beach the gardens of the stately palaces
reached. Chelsea has been called a village of
palaces. A village it was in old times, quite
detached from London, and considered a country
residence by many a famous nobleman and statesman.
On the site of the row of houses in Cheyne
Walk stood the New Manor House built by Henry
VIII. as part of the jointure of Catherine Parr,
who afterwards lived here with her fourth husband,
Thomas Seymour, Lord High Admiral. Both
Princess Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey spent part
of their childhood in it. The palace of the Bishops
of Winchester, at Southwark, having become
dilapidated, as we have seen, a new one was built
at Chelsea in 1663, and was occupied by eight
successive bishops. Shrewsbury House was another
palace built in the reign of Henry VIII. The
wife of the Earl of Shrewsbury was the founder of
Chatsworth, Oldcotes and Hardwick. In Lawrence
or Monmouth House, near the church, lived
Smollett the novelist, and further on, somewhere
near the end of Beaufort Street, was the house
once occupied by Sir Thomas More, whose memory
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226'>[226]</a></span>
is still cherished in Chelsea. No garden among all
the famous gardens of Chelsea was so carefully
tended as his. When More had been made Lord
Chancellor, and had spent his days hearing cases in
the stuffy precincts of the court, how joyfully must
he have stepped into his barge in the cool of the
evening, to be rowed back up-stream to his roses
and his children, where he could indulge his kindly
humour and his playfulness, and unbend without
fear. Sometimes the royal barge would sweep up
after him, and the tyrant Harry himself spring
ashore and walk up and down the sweet-scented
alleys, with his arm round the Chancellor's neck, a
dangerous fondness that in time resulted in More's
being cut off altogether from his garden and his
peaceful evenings, and in his going down that
stream never to return. His monument is in the
church, with an inscription written by himself, but
whether his body lies here is a question that can
never be definitely answered.

Beyond Battersea Bridge is a little creek, and

<p>
Turner brings us to modern memories. Besides
himself and Carlyle, there lived in Chelsea, Rossetti
and George Eliot, not to mention living men.
</p>

<p>
Opposite Chelsea is the long wall that bounds
Battersea Park, and after passing Battersea Bridge,
we encounter a very unlovely strip of water, with
wharves and chimneys and tumble-down buildings.
It is utilitarian and not beautiful.
</p>

<p>
The green embankment which hems in the
grounds of Hurlingham Club gives a touch of
relief, and the fine trees which existed long before
the club, since the time that the house was a
private mansion, rise towering above it. On the
other side the river Wandle, from which Wandsworth
takes its name, a river known to few, empties
itself into the Thames. Then we reach Putney
Bridge, with its wide, curved white arches. On
the east is another embankment which bounds
Bishop's Park, partly turned into pleasure gardens
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228'>[228]</a></span>
open to all the world. The palace itself is not well
seen from the river, for it is low and hidden by
trees.
</p>

<p>
The manor of Fulham has belonged to the See
of London since the end of the seventh century.
The palace is built round two courtyards, the
older of which dates from Henry VII.'s reign,
and the other from the middle of the eighteenth
century. The west or river side contains the rooms
used by Laud while he was bishop.
</p>

<p>
As we draw away from the bridge we see to
advantage the two churches, curiously alike, one
belonging to Putney and the other to Fulham,
which stand at two corners of the bridge, diagonally,
looking at one another. Boat-houses and flats fill
up the western shore until they are succeeded by
the trees of Barn Elms Park, otherwise known as
Ranelagh. The chief memories of Ranelagh centre
about the Kit-Kat Club, which met here, and
included among the members such men as Walpole,
Vanbrugh, Congreve, Addison and Steele. Their
portraits were all painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller,
and hung round the club room; consequently, this
particular size of portrait, 36 inches by 28, became
known as a kit-kat. The name of the club itself
is said to have originated in a pastrycook named
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
Christopher Kat, who used to make excellent
mutton pies, called Kit-Kats, which were always
included in the bill of fare at club dinners.
</p>

<p>
Many a visit did Evelyn and Pepys and other
notable Londoners make to Barn Elms in summer
evenings in the seventeenth century. Pepys was
particularly fond of idling under the well-grown
trees. Hear him:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
After dinner, by water, the day being mighty pleasant,
and the tide serving finely, I up as high as Barne Elmes
and there took one turn alone.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This was in April; and another time:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I walked the length of the Elmes, and with great
pleasure saw some gallant ladies and people come with
their bottles and baskets and chairs, to sup under the trees
by the water-side, which was mighty pleasant.
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the opposite side of the river from Barn Elms
stood Brandenburg House, where lived Queen
Caroline, unhappy consort of George IV.
</p>

<p>
Below Hammersmith Bridge there is a very
untidy bit of foreshore, with factories and chimneys
and many dreary objects scattered about it, and
always a superfluity of clumsy barges. Beyond
the fine suspension bridge there is another bit of
foreshore not quite so untidy, where racing boats
and other boats lie, and from which many a crew
turns out to practice. Along this stretch runs the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>[230]</a></span>
Mall, Upper and Lower. In the coffee house
near the junction of the two, Thomson wrote
"Winter," in <i>The Seasons</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Mall is associated with the Kelmscott Press,
founded by William Morris, who named it after his
country house. Turner lived in the Mall for six
years, and the novelist Marryat was a resident for
a short time in 1830. Here also was a large house
occupied by Catherine of Braganza after the death
of Charles II. The river at Hammersmith is 750
feet wide. The inhabitants make the bridge a
favourite lounging place, for seats line both sides;
the total amount of fresh air thus imbibed no man
can calculate, for the tide races up bringing ozone
straight from the sea, and the wind blows freshly
over the glittering water. On the south bank are
the reservoirs of a large water company.
</p>

<p>
With Hammersmith we must end this chapter,
for we have joined the account of the stream of
pleasure which comes down to London.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIX<br /><br />
<span class="s08">
OUR NATIONAL POSSESSION
</span></h2>

<p>
The Thames is a great national possession,
affording means of recreation and delight to
thousands yearly. It is difficult to compare it
with anything else in Great Britain. It stands
by itself, and is unique. Other rivers there are,
which for a small part of their course are
excellent for boating; but there is nothing
in England to equal the Thames, where the
water is now kept at a high level, and where,
for the 112 miles between London Bridge and
Oxford, there is practically continuous beauty and
convenience for boating. The reproach has been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232'>[232]</a></span>
brought against us that we do not make full use
of our river at London as the Parisians do of the
Seine at Paris. But the two things are not on the
same footing at all. There are many problems in
connection with the Thames as a tidal river that
have not to be solved by the Parisians in regard
to the Seine. Perhaps if the great barrage at
Gravesend, which has been discussed, ever comes
into existence, we shall be able to remove the
reproach, to run our steamboats to time, and to use
the river as a river of pleasure, even so far down as
London Bridge. There are, however, grave objections
to the barrage scheme, which for the present
has been set aside. Though the tides interfere with
pleasure boats, they are a source of motive power
for innumerable barges; the river traffic would
be seriously hindered by the elimination of the
element of tide, and many owners of wharves
and quays would be injured by the change.
There are also other difficulties. At present the
sewage, after being dealt with by filtration in
sewage-beds, is returned to the river, and, having
been rendered innocuous, floats out to sea, and
mingles with the pure water satisfactorily. It
would, however, be another thing to return
thousands of gallons of water, which, however
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233'>[233]</a></span>
innocuous, can hardly be called clean, to the great
lake of fresh water the river would become if
dammed up by a barrage.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i461" id="i461"></a>
<img src="images/i-461.jpg" width="550" height="441" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FROM BATTERSEA BRIDGE
</p>
</div>

<p>
Yet the continual increase in the size of ships,
and the consequent demand for a river ever deeper,
is a source of perplexity to the Thames Conservancy.
This involves constant dredging, which
would not be necessary were a perpetual high tide
to be maintained. It is true that this dredging in
some parts is a source of profit, not of expense.
Thames gravel is exceedingly valuable, and it is
found to be worth while for men not only to buy
and maintain large dredgers down near the river
mouth, but to pay a rent of something like £1500
to the Conservancy for the privilege of doing so!
The dredging, however, is not all so profitable.
Where the river-bed is slime and mud, the channel
has to be kept clear by dredgers at the expense of
the Conservancy, and no delightful rents accrue
from the process. This dredging is altogether rather
an interesting matter. In some places it is found
remunerative enough for men to do it by hand
for the sake of what they bring up, and they obtain
leave to go dredging.
</p>

<p>
It is a fact not realised by everyone that the
whole river, and all the craft upon it are under the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>[234]</a></span>
strictest surveillance. Everything that floats must
be licensed and carry its number for purposes of
ready identification. The barges seen lying about
in shoals near Westminster or Waterloo Bridges
are not lying haphazard, but in certain specified
places marked by buoys and allotted by the Conservancy,
much as cabstands are allotted by the
police. It is true that quays, wharves, landing
stages, etc., being on land, are not subject to the
Conservancy, which is in the somewhat anomalous
position of dealing with the water, but not with
the banks that hem it in. Yet the Conservancy
manages to have a finger in this too, for suppose
a man buys a bit of the river's bank, and erects a
boat-building establishment thereon, he is obviously
at a loss without steps down to the water or a
landing place, and for this he has to pay rent to
the Conservancy. The amusing part of it is that a
man's property is sometimes in the air. In the case
of a tree growing out of the water, it would truly
tax the judgment of a Solomon to say what the
rights of the Conservancy are toward that tree; but
it is held that if the tree constitutes any danger or
obstruction to the river-way the Conservators may
insist on its being lopped. In connection with this
a curious case sometimes arises. Man is always
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
cunning where his own interests are concerned. It
is not only to one man that the idea has occurred
of propping up his overhanging tree by a stake.
And, if the stake remains for any length of time,
silt and rubbish collect between it and the shore,
and eventually the island or the land of the cunning
man is enlarged by a foot or two! More; sometimes
stakes have been planted in the river bed with
the same object without even excuse of the tree.
It is the duty of the Conservancy officials to
deal with all such stakes.
</p>

<p>
Whatever may be alleged as to our neglect of
the river at London, no such charge can be brought
against us in our appreciation of it higher up. Day
by day, in the summer, hundreds enjoy the air and
the brilliance and the interest of the river reaches.
House-boats are moored, permission and licences
having been obtained, and men and women
practically live in the open air for weeks together.
The house-boats are not allowed to anchor
everywhere, but are allotted certain stations, due
regard being had to the width of the river. If
they plant themselves near private ground they
must gain the permission of the owner, as well as
of the Conservancy, which is quite reasonable.
</p>

<p>
To preserve an unimpeded channel may be taken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236'>[236]</a></span>
as one of the great duties of the Conservancy. For
this reason they have power to remove snags; to
prevent the egotistical punt-fisher from placing his
punt broadside in the midmost current; and to
regulate the rules for the passing of craft. It is
rather amusing to see sometimes how the punt
man edges his craft as far from the bank as he dare
before he sits down on his cane-bottomed chair
and sorts out his tackle; but if a Conservancy
official come along, and, eyeing him, decides, in
spite of his extreme innocency and unconsciousness,
that he has encroached too far, back he has
to go. It is a perpetual game.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the fishing, most of the Thames
is free; and the coarse fishing&mdash;bream, dace, chub,
and so on&mdash;is good of its kind. Here and there,
as at Hedsor, there is a bit preserved. For the
commonsense view is taken that, if both banks
belong to the same owner, the river bed belongs
also to him, and likewise the fishing. He cannot,
however, prevent boats from passing up and down
the stream flowing through his property, or the
highway would be a highway no more. The fishery
in the Thames has of late years greatly improved,
owing to the disinterested action of many clubs
and associations in putting in stock which they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237'>[237]</a></span>
cannot hope subsequently to reclaim, but which,
once gone into the water, belongs to everyone
alike. An instance of this occurred recently, when
300 trout (<i>Salmo fario</i>), about fourteen inches
long, were put into the Thames at Shepperton
Weir in March by the Weybridge, Shepperton,
and Halliford Thames Trout Stocking Association.
These trout cost 2s. 6d. each! There is good coarse
fishing in nearly all parts of the Thames; bream,
dace, chub, perch, and pike can generally be
caught.
</p>

<p>
There are many curious and interesting points
in regard to the river, and none more interesting
than those relating to the tow-path. This venerable
and ancient right-of-way still remains, crossing and
recrossing from side to side as occasion demands,
but traversable from end to end. As, however,
it passes through private grounds by far the greater
part of the way, it <i>is</i> private, and yet public.
Bicycles are frequently forbidden by stern notices
put up by owners, who yet cannot prevent the
pedestrian. The Conservancy has no power over
the tow-path. What, then, happens when a part
of the tow-path gives way and requires making
up again? In theory it is the owner's duty to
do it; but it would be expecting rather more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>[238]</a></span>
than is warranted of human nature to expect an
owner, who must regard the right-of-way with
dislike and suspicion, to incur expense by mending
it. As a matter of fact, if he does not do it, the
Conservancy does. It may be remarked here that
a very simple and effective way of embanking,
known as "camp-shedding," is often employed
about the river banks and the projecting points
of lock islands which are liable to be carried
away by the current. This consists in dropping
large bags of dry cement into the water. The
water itself consolidates and hardens the stuff,
which becomes a splendid barrier.
</p>

<p>
There is another point in connection with the
breaking away of the tow-path which is still
more perplexing. Supposing it breaks away from
a private owner's land in such a way that it cannot
be built up again, but must be carried inland, what
right has the public to say, "My right-of-way has
fallen into the water, so I am going to take some
of your land to replace it"? Apparently none at
all. Yet the tow-path must be carried on. One
wonders how, in the beginning, it was allotted to
one side or the other. How was it that one owner
said, "My lawns must slope right down to the
water's edge; therefore I will not have the tow-path
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'>[239]</a></span>
on my side; let it go upon the other?"
And why has it never happened that two owners,
equally strong and equally determined, have both
flatly refused it? Be that as it may, the tow-path
runs its tortuous but continuous course, and will
continue to run as long as the river flows.
</p>

<p>
Such things as locks and weirs are, of course,
entirely in the power of the Conservancy, who pay
the keepers and regulate the fees. The half-tide
lock at Richmond has answered admirably so far
(<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_196">p. 196</a>); but the question is, Where is this
sort of thing going to stop? There is an idea
now of a similar lock at Wandsworth, and then
we come to the matter of the barrage. We are so
greedy of our river, we want it to be pent up,
and not allowed to flow away to the sea. Weirs
of some sort, which were at first called locks, are
very ancient. In the end of the twelfth century
we find orders respecting them.
</p>

<p>
Stow tells us that about the year 1578 or 1579
there were twenty-three "locks," sixteen mills,
sixteen floodgates and seven weirs on the river
between Maidenhead and Oxford. In the next
six years thirty more locks and weirs had been
made in spite of complaints that many persons
had been drowned "by these stoppages of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'>[240]</a></span>
water." He adds that "the going up the locks was
so steep that every year cables had been broken
that cost £400." Especial complaint was made
about Marlow lock, where one man had had his
brains dashed out, and Stow remarks that all the
compensation the widow received was £5! The
barges were not charged for going up but only for
coming down, and a barge passing from Oxford to
London in Stow's time paid £12 18<i>s.</i> This was
in the summer, when the water was low. In
1585 a petition was made to Queen Elizabeth "in
the name of the widows and fatherless children
whose parents and husbands were by these means
slain, against the great mischief done to her
loving subjects by the great number of dangerous
locks, weirs, mills and floodgates unlawfully
erected in many places on the river." Queen
Elizabeth must have known something of the
subject from her early acquaintance with Bisham.
(<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_105">Chap. XI</a>.)
</p>

<p>
In an old book of 1770 we find this passage:
"The locks were machines of wood placed across
the river, and so contrived to hold the water as long
as convenient, that is, till the water rises to such
a height as to allow of depth enough for the barge
to pass over the shallows, which being effected,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241'>[241]</a></span>
the water is set at liberty, and the loaded vessel
proceeds on its voyage till another shoal requires
the same convenience to carry it forward. This
arrangement was in the summer when the water
was low; in other seasons the locks were removed."
</p>

<p>
When the present locks were made they were
called "pound" locks; a great many of them were
opened between 1770 and 1780.
</p>

<p>
The members of the Conservancy Board go up
in their launch several times a year to see that
all is in order, and that their officials are doing
their duty. Once a year they penetrate beyond
Oxford, where the launch cannot go, and they
have to take to rowing boats. They are not
supposed to preserve the amenities of the river,
but only its highway properties. They have no
power to remove unsightlinesses, such as hideous
advertisement boards; but only obstructions. Yet,
in keeping the river free from sewage contamination;
by forbidding the casting of refuse into the
current from house-boats or elsewhere; by exercising
a general jurisdiction, which makes people
realise they are not free to amuse themselves to
the annoyance of their neighbours&mdash;no doubt the
amenities are very much more preserved than they
would otherwise be.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242'>[242]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Stow ends up his account of the river: "And
thus, as this fine river is of great use and profit to
the city, so the many neat towns and seats on the
banks of it make it extraordinary pleasant and
delightful. So that the citizens and gentlemen,
nay kings, have in the summer time usually taken
the air by water; being carried in boats and barges
along the Thames, both upward and downward
according to their pleasures."

<b>The Times.</b>&mdash;"Mr. Menpes's pictures are here
given in most perfect facsimile, and they form altogether
a series of colour impressions of Japan which
may fairly be called unrivalled. Even without the
narrative they would show that Mr. Menpes is an
enthusiast for Japan, her art and her people; and very
few European artists have succeeded in giving such
complete expression to an admiration in which all
share."

the saving grace of imagination, but is able by the
sympathy and wise knowledge gained by a long
residence in India to write a text of more than
ordinary charm."

<b>The King.</b>&mdash;"Within the last few years the industry
of contemporary writers, some with and others without
a genuine sympathy for their subject, has helped us to
glimpses of the Queen of the Adriatic, through the
spectacles of art, history, archæology, poetry, and
romance; but the <i>Magnum Opus</i> of Mortimer Menpes
embraces to a great degree all five points of view, and
persuades us that at last (and that not a day too soon)
the stones of Venice have found at once a painter and
a writer equally worthy of the vanished glories, the
memories of which still cling to every church, palace,
or bridge drawn or described in this charming
work."

<b>Pall Mall Gazette.</b>&mdash;"It is of course the picturesque
aspects of Brittany that appeal to Mr. Menpes....
Whether he paints cottage interiors or peasant
types, straggling village streets and coast-town alleys,
or a market-place bustling and baking in the sunshine,
it is all one to his graceful pencil; and reproduced, as
the drawings are, by his own colour-process, they make
another of those many charming albums of travel
which Messrs. Black have made a special province of
their own."

<b>The Scotsman.</b>&mdash;"Mr. Menpes has been a wanderer
over the face of the earth armed with brush and
pencil, and he has brought back with him portfolios
filled with samples of the colour and sunshine, and of
the life and form, quaint or beautiful, of the most
famous countries of the East and of the West, and
his charming book is a kind of album into which he
has gathered the cream of an artist's memories and
impressions of the many countries he has visited and
sketched in."

and Mr. Menpes's 100 pictures ... are above all
remarkable for their extraordinary variety of treatment,

admire the more&mdash;the skill of the artist or the skill

nothing in the process. The book, therefore, is a
